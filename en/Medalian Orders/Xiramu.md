# Xiramu

Tags: Medalian World

Xiramu is both a Medalian order and a Medalian species/race. For the most part Xiramus is a mysterious specific and live on its own but Xiramus do offer prophecy services to many different parts of the universe and some of them serve directly as military or political consultants.

Xiramu is the equivalent to "human gods" in terms of the Medalian world. Even the queens may not stand much chance when fighting with a Xiramu though the need for that is shimmer.
