Tags: Name, Tellus, (China/NFC)

(China)-descdent, invented last name by Mr. Leng, used exclusived to identify members of the Leng family/clan. Not inherited biologically - those are 赠送姓. This is a NEW last name occuring only at "present-day NFC".

Notably members are obious so we will not bother enumerating them here.
