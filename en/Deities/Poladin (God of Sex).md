# Poladin (God of Sex) (European)

Tags: Tellus, God, Fepulans Player

Lv 25 Fepulans Player who's been playing in the Central Stage on and off for roughly 2500 years when measured in Tellurian years. When Poladin was on Tellus, he worked hard, spent 10 years on Tellus (occassionally "offline") and intimated half of (European) population to successfully implant the gene. His visit and a large number of names during its encounter are documented in the book "(European) Sex History ()", "源始记" and "爱神录". According to religious scriptures/traditions, there are legacies (which are apparently not true) that Poladin died in her last sex act, asending with her fellow Tellurians to the land of Euphoria in spiritual form (the reality is she just left Tellus and went back to play in Central Stage of Universe).

* Notice he has to be of male nature if he's to cause birth rather than giving birth; It's not ideal for God to give birth.
* He could be of female nature if all she does is to implant a symbol (inside male scrotum) and for the guy to pregnate the next woman to actually cause generic passing.
