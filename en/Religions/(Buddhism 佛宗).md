佛宗的修行是泰勒斯上关于Metahuman/Posthuman最高超和古老的技艺——通过修行可以实现人死后超生成佛，实在是一种超越Xiramu或者Fepulans的技术。佛界是一种超越和共存于物质境界的世界。所谓佛性，具体就是指在修佛过程中来领略体会佛界特性、摆脱和减少现世界的特性，所以佛戒，并非禁断，而是提前可以感知到佛界存在，当这种感知联系强烈到一定程度，就可以就地飞升。在这个世界里，修佛分为大乘/归一乘和小乘：归一乘的目的是飞升成佛，小乘的目的是摆脱俗世之苦海、更好的活着。这样的目标使得一切佛宗教条获得动机，但是这个目标本身是一个risk：需要信仰和选择。难就难在除非是从小教育这种信仰，否则后天之人后面因为很难获得佛性体验，所以一般不会主动做这种信仰选择。

The Buddhism traditions can be broadly classified in a few dimensions:

1. 大乘, 小乘, 上上乘: Among those, the 上上乘 is a very unique style that's practiced OUTSIDE original and the ancient 发源地 and cultural center of Buddhism (i.e. namely, outside Hanuda and Kanit).

## Origin

Oringated in 汉努达.

## Elevation

The spread in Gandi (甘地) took a unique turn - it fostered 甘传佛宗, or 甘藏/甘地密藏（密宗）, which adds a new development of 虹化飞升之修行，

## Popularity in the East

Even though Kanit is to the east of Gandi, but since the original spread was done by 佛祖穆莫哈德from汉努达, and 甘藏 didn't form untill later - the dominant/only form of Buddhism in Kanit is still the original (with some localization) Buddhism.

"If it's real, why no one has ever seen it before?"
"Well, it's not exactly a secret - if you visit there, you can (indeed) see those people. It's just you've never been there before, and the group is rather introvert and it doesn't share everything online." (idea from) Some groups/organizations and internal processings are not necessarily secretive but it's not intentionally public and advertised about, so there are knowledge and information (e.g. how a business operates) that one must be in that organization to be able to see it. For Buddhism's 甘藏 - there are indeed 修真高人 that exist as in this world, but only internal circles know of it because they don't otherwise draw attention to themselves (because their utility is ultimately not in this world and they almost never ever get involved in political matters - however there are notably examples in ancient wars but due to lack of documentation they are legends now).

# (New) Theme: Life after Death

> It's a half-well-known fact that beyond, below and on Tellus, there are gods, there are spirits, and there are humans.

The religion (Buddhism) on Tellus is VERY different from buddhism on earth, and we can construct it based on the theme of "life after death".
世界有因果物理，有轮回循环，但却没有善恶报应。地界不管人间事，而轮回只是一个选择。

(Buddhism)的最核心教义是活着就是为了准备死后的事情(or rather, either legacy, or next life)。而具体这是指什么，则不同的流派分支有不同的解读和做法。如果是为轮回做准备，那么打通关系，找到可能的投生地点是重点；如果是为在地界安生做准备，则此生只是经历——由此可生三种性格：妒世，献世，以及玩世；如果死后是为了开启另一步重要大门，或者在多次轮回或者在当前轮回，积累足够多的隐秘的物质资料，以便死后飞升，脱离地球，则是重中之重；如果是为了成仙立道，追寻神迹，那又是另一番话题。
