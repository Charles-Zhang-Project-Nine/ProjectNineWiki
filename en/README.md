### Concepts (x12)

|Entry|Description|Link|

|Artificial Brain|**The Primitive Era**|[Link](./Concepts/Artificial%20Brain)|
|Center of Universe (CU)|(CONSIDER MOVING TO CONSTRUCT)|[Link](./Concepts/Center%20of%20Universe%20(CU))|
|Central Stage of Universe (CSU)|A region within The Simulatione. It's considered the most densely populated region within The Simulatione and the only region where Fepulans Players can travel freely into. The cental stage of universe is teeming is Fepulans Players, legendary miracles, human/fepulans-like NPCs/people, and original Simulatione life forms and artificial simulatione life forms. |[Link](./Concepts/Central%20Stage%20of%20Universe%20(CSU))|
|Concentrated Vacuum Energy|Concentrated Plank/Dark Energy, or Concentrated Vacuum Energy, is a form of accelerated kinetic energy/quantum inertia generated using quantum means with special nano-emitters, that can achieve effects similar to what's called traditionally "magic" with modern means.|[Link](./Concepts/Concentrated%20Vacuum%20Energy)|
|Concept - Inner God (Inner Divinity)|(PENDING CONSIDERING HOW THIS MAY OR MAY NOT BE DEVELOPED AS A THEME - IN WHICH CASE IT WILL BE 渗透到 ALL ASPECTS OF OUR WRITING OR BE ILLUSTRATED AS SPECIFIC SCENES. WITHOUT BEING RECOGNIZED AS A THEME, THEN IT CAN BE JUST A PLOT ITEM)|[Link](./Concepts/Concept%20-%20Inner%20God%20(Inner%20Divinity))|
|Interstellar Human (Tellurian) Trafficking|* (Plot, theme, style, 魔幻现实, #Novel, #Content, Management) Medalian people buy, sell, capture, and showcase enslaved humans - this is unavoidable since the security on earth and technology on earth is so low and easily penetratable, anyone with that capacity will immediately seize the market and make a profit - there will definitely be at least a few dozen people having this need, idea and desire to visit humans, and when such needs cannot be easily satisfied by joining the expedition team, they will seek a "twisted" version of the realization, thus folstering the inter-galactic slave business. Such enslaving is manefested in many many aspects, from simple pet stores in the Undercity to captures and transportation (human trafficking) to prostitution to child marriage to much more elaborate trained individual human servants with high status. The trade involves all countries, all levels of government, politics and bribery. Other more interesting manifesctations include **paintings** - from basic illustration as record of individuals, to illustrations of activities performed by enslaved people, to more expensive Exotic Oil painted masterfully crafted piece of arts of those people, sold back to the original planet (also it's worth mentioning despite the high level of space technology, the diverse culture and long historical heritage of Medala necessarily implies that the development will NOT be universal or equal - e.g. some parts of Kai will be much more highly developed than other parts, and the more rural parts of the source planets might even be considered "rural"). The key here for the purpose of the novel is to make it bizarre - and think back and in reference to the slave trade, and those events described in the two novels: **百年孤独** and **Candide**.|[Link](./Concepts/Interstellar%20Human%20(Tellurian)%20Trafficking)|
|Lakə (The Inherent Divinity)|A potentiality encoded in Medalian (and its ancestor) genes that essentially gives potential to any Medalian to get to know/feel/perceive or become God, the effect is equivalent to invoking or using PortKey. This gene is unlocked starting with Second Queen by the First Queen as inheritage of Queen's thrones.|[Link](./Concepts/Lakə%20(The%20Inherent%20Divinity))|
|Medalian (Miah) Council Structure|<!--(Idea, culture, queen) When the 6th queen takes the ritual and departs, the most memorable people/special memory she shall have would be with her students and the other Chancellors. Notice Chancellors don't have private army.|[Link](./Concepts/Medalian%20(Miah)%20Council%20Structure)|
|Medalian Queens|Queens all have very distinct look, and not all of them look like human. They come from different original regions/countries, and have distinct, and sometimes personal goals, even though they all share the same "will".|[Link](./Concepts/Medalian%20Queens)|
|Tellurian Gods|Tellurian gods are understood to be Fepulans players that frequents the planet of Tellus and the Sol System and leaves their legacies there.|[Link](./Concepts/Tellurian%20Gods)|

### Constructs (x15)

|Entry|Description|Link|
|-|-|-|
|Animal Intelligence|Are their high protein (non-lentil) leafy/green plant substitutes or roots?|[Link](./Constructs/Animal%20Intelligence)|
|Blackhole Technologies|(We put this under Construct for now for summarization purpose, as we develop more specific notes, we could move them to corresponding Technology entries)|[Link](./Constructs/Blackhole%20Technologies)|
|Fepulans Players|Celetial beings possessing massive energy and the ability of transformation.|[Link](./Constructs/Fepulans%20Players)|
|Legendary Objects 神器|Legendary objects are contained within themselves the connection to the origin of worlds. Almost all legendary objects are directly or indirectly built by gods - or someone attaining the level of power as gods. Legendary objects are legendary/legend because: 1) They are one of a kind, 2) They are not usually seen, or may not even possess a physical form, 3) Their power (in terms of destructive or constructive) is at least comparable to a dozen countries' collective effort, in terms of power output, it's at least a few dozen nuclear power plants - some are even much more extraordinary; 3) It's possessed by a single (group of) person at a time, and thus the access to it is limited, 4) There are lots of tales/folklores/legends/myth surrouding the object and the object likely has a long history (>2000 years); 5) Most original legendary objects are built by gods (Fepulans players), notably few exceptions are constructed by man (humans/tellurians, medalians, krukians) - actually maybe just Kun VI Chamurika and some Krukian genius; 6) They condese lots of energy/power/substance/structure within very limited space/form/shell. Due to their superbly powerful nature and high-level construct, those legendary objects can usually be put into a variety of ingenous use. However, they do have limits, and we typically very very rarely allow things that are galactical scale.|[Link](./Constructs/Legendary%20Objects%20神器)|
|Life After Death|(PENDING MERGING WITH THEME on the same topic)|[Link](./Constructs/Life%20After%20Death)|
|Magic|There are three or more forms of magic in our system:|[Link](./Constructs/Magic)|
|Naturals|(PENDING MERGING with Wiki topic on Magic)|[Link](./Constructs/Naturals)|
|Programmed Death Procedure|This is a Tellurian-specific construct. Programmed Procedure is a special sequence of actions conditioned on specific contexts and will happen when triggered and before death. Those proceures are powerful symbols in that they are observable by outsiders and leads to certain death.|[Link](./Constructs/Programmed%20Death%20Procedure)|
|Prophecy and Future-Seeing|Being able to see the future is a premise of Hyupdeda and a natural consequence of physical permeability of time travel. Notice there is a big difference between seeing the future and "predicting" the future in the sense of 演算 consequences and gaining strategical information. Both Medalian Hyupeda and Xiramus can see the future but only the Hyupeda has the capacity to actually "predict" and in a sense "query" the future. Xiramus can directly see what's going to happen in the future on things that are directly relevant or presented to them, but they cannot ask questions or inquiry further about the ins-and-outs of events. On the other hand, the future that Xiramus see DO CHANGE when conditions change, while when Hyupeda tells something will happen, it is physically bound to happen - though the trick with Hyupeda is how you ask the exact question.|[Link](./Constructs/Prophecy%20and%20Future-Seeing)|
|Simulatione|(Fepulans) Simulatione装置是一个人造的mini黑洞（因为如果用捕获的黑洞太大了也难以控制），所以得降维。(Mini) 黑洞的Event Horizon是一种可编程的界限，黑洞内部有无限（可编程）可能。The difficult thing is not to send stuff in - it's literally a suck hole - but how to take stuff out: how to probe its states. There are certain states we can never know (like how's your favorite girl's first time who never liked you and is not talking to you any more).|[Link](./Constructs/Simulatione)|
|Super Realm|(Originally a dated idea per 20230415, but I think we can skip the "Dated Item" queue and promote it to an official concept directly)|[Link](./Constructs/Super%20Realm)|
|Tellurian Mythology|(This note would be relevant to the theme/construct of "life after death")|[Link](./Constructs/Tellurian%20Mythology)|
|Tellurian Sexuality|Sex is noble, not morally, but in the sense of the final "reward" - the creators gives us the final pleasure as a reward for achieving the noble goal of delivery life to the next generation. On Tellus, due to mystical/magical reasons, sex can have the following three consequences:|[Link](./Constructs/Tellurian%20Sexuality)|
|The Many Worlds|(Inpsired by the officialization of the idea regarding Dreams and magic in P9 world; Originally an independent RPG game-oriented 剑坊 design)|[Link](./Constructs/The%20Many%20Worlds)|
|世界特异性|Those are some misc. very specific points/ideas, though if we investigate the underlying mechanism, they may be developed into whole systems, or at least other variants along the same line/style can be derived.|[Link](./Constructs/世界特异性)|

### Countries of the World (x5)

|(东骊共和国)|* 东骊 (idea from) Lily works in 东立.|[Link](./Countries/(东骊共和国))|
|Haiti|Very small country. Dictatorship Monopoly Diplomacy like Singapore with tense battle-state relationship with neighbouring countries over territory issue.|[Link](./Countries/Haiti)|
|Karado|* (20230723) 讲真这一路下来，也没啥特别有趣的见闻😂 感觉纽约挺适合购物，那地方是真的大（虽然脏乱差）。剧院也挺多，可是这种演出一场都要好几百RMB，也不是什么可以天天看的东西。相比之下还是想去日本，哈哈😂 A country, due to bottleneck of technology and culture - they had long history, used to be VERY violent and now democratic and peaceful, and they had EVERYTHING THEY COULD EVER HAVE, people have no desire to spend money any more. 民族气质：世间繁华不过如此。|[Link](./Countries/Karado)|
|Sota|Sota is a developing country with large populations and abundant resources and mid-length history. It's the manufacturing center of the present world for Medalian space industry. Because of its nature as developing country, a lot of stuff there is NOT regulated and 山寨 industry is very robust. Cheap manufacturing of all kinds are readily accessible in all regions of the country - a lot of stuff would otherwise be not permitted in other countries.|[Link](./Countries/Sota)|
|The Holy City|Recognized by all countries around the Appes Lake, The Holy City is a dedicated theo-shrine for (Tellurian) God (PENDING) and has supreme status over the sovereignty over many neighboring countries and more distant regions - in fact, the entire West continent recognizes God (PENDING) and thus The Holy City - even (China), which is governed by an atheist party. With less than 1000 permanent population and less than 120 acre of area, it's the smallest country in the world by population and by area.|[Link](./Countries/The%20Holy%20City)|

### Culture (x5)

|Entry|Description|Link|
|-|-|-|
|(Giant Event Halls)|* (Medala, dream inspired, idea, #20220526, Wiki, Cultural, Design, Element) Medalian event halls are gigantic - like football stadiums. As such, people hold handheld device (like virtual camera) to watch. (Remark, #20220530) This CANNOT possibly be attributed to the entire race - we should attribute this to a particular kingdom because that's more likely, since Medalian race is very diverse. Certainly it's a very notable feature for those who didn't know Medala and the diversity that much and just visited Ids for the first time and this can be a general trend - but the bottom line is it cannot be everything, otherwise it becomes the pop-culture mass-produced high-way systems and fast-food chain of Canada.|[Link](./Culture/(Giant%20Event%20Halls))|
|(Konralika People Name Culture)|A proper name is a noun that identifies a single entity and is used to refer to that entity (Africa, Jupiter, Sarah, Tesla, Inc.) as distinguished from a common noun, which is a noun that refers to a class of entities (continent, planet, person, corporation) and may be used when referring to instances of a specific class (a continent, another planet, these persons, our corporation).|[Link](./Culture/(Konralika%20People%20Name%20Culture))|
|Medala Naming Culture|Historically, name is just a way for people to identify each other, and it could be as simple as a single word. Gradually, as certain families and identities/groups/glans develop, people start to inherit part of the word and that becomes family name. Other specific names are derived similarly. Some names are used together to collectively represent a "full name", otherwise, certain names are alternatives for identifying the same person and is equivalent to a full name.|[Link](./Culture/Medala%20Naming%20Culture)|
|Tellurian Lifestyle|It's apparently a big topic and varies geographically by country and throughout history and depends on religion, but in this entry we talk about some very high-level commonalities and in particular we may contrast it with other alien life forms.|[Link](./Culture/Tellurian%20Lifestyle)|

### Gods and Deities (x1)

|Entry|Description|Link|
|-|-|-|
|Poladin (God of Sex)|Lv 25 Fepulans Player who's been playing in the Central Stage on and off for roughly 2500 years when measured in Tellurian years. When Poladin was on Tellus, he worked hard, spent 10 years on Tellus (occassionally "offline") and intimated half of (European) population to successfully implant the gene. His visit and a large number of names during its encounter are documented in the book "(European) Sex History ()", "源始记" and "爱神录". According to religious scriptures/traditions, there are legacies (which are apparently not true) that Poladin died in her last sex act, asending with her fellow Tellurians to the land of Euphoria in spiritual form (the reality is she just left Tellus and went back to play in Central Stage of Universe).|[Link](./Deities/Poladin%20(God%20of%20Sex))|

### Descipline (x1)

### Economics (x1)

|Entry|Description|Link|
|-|-|-|
|Cryptocurrency|Originally used specifically for TGC games and advocated by Interworld Economics, and designed by a guy named Satoshi Nakamoto, it soon became an interesting commodity throughout the Tellurian world.

|The Great Expedition|(NOTICE THAT THE CANONICAL NEVER TALKED ABOUT WHETHRE OR NOT THEY EVENTUALLY MADE TO EVA)|[Link](./Events/The%20Great%20Expedition)|
|The Great Mythology|Having a few (around 1-5) complete mythology systems is very useful in constructing further culture from them, and also very useful in making cultural references and naming things at modern times. The Great Mythology concerns a thread/system of mythology that is surrounded around the three initial Gods that created Tellurians on Tellus. The key focus here is specific actions, needs/desires/conflicts, meanings and symbology, and names of gods.|[Link](./Events/The%20Great%20Mythology)|
|The Medalian Visit (The First Contact)|The Medalian didn't even intend to pass by Tellus, and the visit is an accident. When the expedition team first detected X13 and eventually detected Tellus, they were surprised and thought maybe their course to Eva was mistaken and this might be it because of the similarities between Tellus and Eva (from description or observation from Hyypeda) - hence they gave Tellus the name Evatux. Then after they see and learnt a bit more about the planet, they known they were wrong. However they are curious and interested in establishing some contact.|[Link](./Events/The%20Medalian%20Visit%20(The%20First%20Contact))|

White sheets of rice starch are rolled with various fillings. Some popular choices are beef/pork, shrimp, even oyster, with mushroom, egg, lettuce, watercress etc. The rolls are steamed till all flavors blender together and then sprinkled with cooked peanut oil, raw soy sauce, chili sauce, or sesame paste depending on individual preferences.|[Link](./Food/Steamed%20Vermicelli%20Rolls)|

|Week of Learning|It's customary tradition since Queen I (and publication of 天下诏书) that there is a yearly Week of Learning where all walks of life stop their work and learn topics of greater concern: Civic, law, language, major science. Published by government for all ages. The idea is that this way people are informed and great achievements can be inspired from the general public. (The original motivation was that after certain age, the majority of population are dumb and just comfortable with staying as is, and that's why they fear progress and loss of job) This paid holiday is an encouragement but not an enforcement. Great governmental media use is necessary for it to be successful.|[Link](./Holidays/Week%20of%20Learning)|

|Robotic Marriage 机器人法案 - 机器人婚姻法|* (Social) The legalization of this is WHAT PEOPLE/ROBOTS wanted - just like lesibians and gays want their recognition. Ever since there is intelligent enough AI and there is intelligent enough AI robots, the affection between humans and robots are unavoidable. A very nice illustration of this is in the movie Megan 2023 (which can also be a fictional movie - albeit with a differet name - inside P9 universe that talks directly about romance between man and female woman). However, the events involving the publicity of Sobia made this to the front page of news - the dream-inspired character (Sobia) who works in a fast-food restaurant.

|Dreams|Dreams (in the P9 world) are a bridge to THE alternative reality. In P9, people's dreams are consistent in a sense that the things they interact with ARE a reality that exists in the Dream Realm or the Astral Plane. They are however, highly individualized BUT can be connected with some internal or external help. (The original motivation for this is for people to be able to take things out from their dreams.)|[Link](./Legends/Dreams)|
|Queen's Hidden Treasure|The first queen hides away a mysterious treasure that will grant the finder enormous power. Kun VII found it, and it's a message: The world will end in some 3500+ years - she found it when she was an apparatus and doing testing with the Portkey (as a way of selection for the next Queen), and she told her 领路人 (Kun VI). The only other knowing this was probably Kun I. Kun I has long been living "outside this world" - only her body is preserved but for the most time she's not really with us (so the council operates with 5 chancellers most of the time).|[Link](./Legends/Queen's%20Hidden%20Treasure)|

|Ikuria|Ikuria people ARE a more suprior species. They are also among the first explorers and by far the best and furtherest explorers of our universe. For those reasons,  they naturally consider themselves above everyone else - even Medala and the original Kainians. They are also ruthless and can be violent and cold-blooded towards "lower life forms" - examples being the harvest for strange matters and human trafficking of earthlings. They even once dreamt of conquering Medala and invaded Doma System (with both a rebellion inside and forces from the outside) some 7000 years ago. They were very powerful (and Krurks naturally don't participate in this war nor help anyone) and almost reached Kai, when the true form of Queen showed up and defeated them once and for all and controlled them afterwards.|[Link](./Medalian Orders/Ikuria)|

|(Ancient) Balnum|An ancient city-state that once was quite glorious in the chapters of history. (It's treated as equivalanet of Rome or Greek in our world).|[Link](./Nations/(Ancient)%20Balnum)|
|(Female Kingdom)|(Idea from) Why are (most) females in our reality so inferior, intellectually and emotionally speaking, notably in China (actually most western woman are pretty much the same as man it seemed)? We should have a kingdom where females are predominant and dominant, ideally without man at all - for instance, they can exclusively use sperm banks for choice of ideal breeding and send out all instances of male babies. Hard to imagine how this is enforced on the government level - maybe not through laws and law enforcements, but more through (like China) long-time 传统观念. No matter how we develop it, it's a very morally interesting topic and is very relevant to Euphoria and The Last Order's gender/marriage/romance movements.|[Link](./Nations/(Female%20Kingdom))|
|(The super power of Tellus)|* Upon entering the space age, or at the edge of entering space age, it has severe competition with other countries to quickly explore and expand its terrotory to outer space. Automation only solves so many problems and there is still great need for manual labour. The surprising turn of event is the great reduction in cost in 航天仪器 due to trading and cultural exchange with Miah - now they just need people and investment to get this working. This country as advanced as it is doesn't have that many local population, so what can it do? Well, it collaborated with Kanit/Instellar Mission to use human trafficked population to do such dirty job - the government might not need to be fully aware of all the nitty gritties and it can work especially well if there is some sort of systematic corruption within certain departments.|[Link](./Nations/(The%20super%20power%20of%20Tellus))|

|(Citadel of) Capital Investments (CCI)|Originally founded by Mr. Leng and Tao Ye, Citadel of Capital Investments is a key establishing pillar of many aspects of NFC and a large popular project funds based on NFC. It's the means of establishing large civic influence without going through the political path. Many of the otherwise large-scale "arbitrary" projects are funded directly or indirectly by CCI, including CofN Open Platform, and The Many Worlds gaming network. Surprisingly, as an "investment firm", CCI is not profit driven when it comes to private investments - a large portion of its allocable funds for private investments are channeled directly from capitals of very rich investors (kind of like angel investment) rather than rely on existing fund returns. In terms of trading, the biggest advantage of CCI is its quantitative strategies and arbitrage capacities, including the initial proprietary algorithms developed by Tao Ye before Mr. Leng funded NFC. CCI provides the initial funding and support for those long-term large-scale wholistic projects in the hope that over the long term the financial benefits are considerable - or even if not, the money is owned by various interested investors and the loss is assumed. Many of the prominent investors are associated with TLO and they are super rich. Notably, even not always with support from other stakeholders, just Tao Ye and Mr. Leng is capable of injecting funds directly because they are the main stakeholders. The company (as of "present day") currently employees around 3500 employees and manages funds and investment projects internationally. One key feature of CCI is it tries best to manage lots of stuff internally in order to minimize operational cost and reduce communication overhead and impose fine-grained control. Among other assets, CCI directly owns The Flying Castle, which is leased to NFC military.|[Link](./Organizations/(Citadel%20of)%20Capital%20Investments%20(CCI))|

|Song Can 宋粲|宋粲是冷先胜手下一个写历史、编故事的 <!--Maybe Song Can can focus more on 正史 and fictional stories - I mean, when we say he works for Mr. Leng for history and story-making, I didn’t mean he is making fake history. On the other hand, I think Mr. Leng would want someone who is knowledgable to help him dig real history so Mr. Leng can gain more insight into some legends. The story-making function of Song Can might be to create CofN-native mythologies etc. for entertaining the public. To summarize, in general, there shouldn’t be any need for Mr. Leng to fake whatever history for political purpose - however it might make sense for Mr. Leng to “hide” certain confidential information that he doesn’t want the public to know (e.g. if the existence of the Undercity is a secret - which I am not so certain these days).-->。|[Link](./People/Song%20Can%20宋粲)|

The people living there are exactly like that on Earth, and two major events take place in the year 1997 or something: 1) Alien signal contact, 2) Travelling through man-made teleports and bypassing all gateways and eventually witness the civilization of an alien civilization that explores that "Voyager Program" for the lower civilizations.

### Religions (x7)

|Entry|Description|Link|
|-|-|-|
|(Buddhism 佛宗)|佛宗的修行是泰勒斯上关于Metahuman/Posthuman最高超和古老的技艺——通过修行可以实现人死后超生成佛，实在是一种超越Xiramu或者Fepulans的技术。佛界是一种超越和共存于物质境界的世界。所谓佛性，具体就是指在修佛过程中来领略体会佛界特性、摆脱和减少现世界的特性，所以佛戒，并非禁断，而是提前可以感知到佛界存在，当这种感知联系强烈到一定程度，就可以就地飞升。在这个世界里，修佛分为大乘/归一乘和小乘：归一乘的目的是飞升成佛，小乘的目的是摆脱俗世之苦海、更好的活着。这样的目标使得一切佛宗教条获得动机，但是这个目标本身是一个risk：需要信仰和选择。难就难在除非是从小教育这种信仰，否则后天之人后面因为很难获得佛性体验，所以一般不会主动做这种信仰选择。|[Link](./Religions/(Buddhism%20佛宗))|
|(Medalian Inspired Tellurian Religion - Original Branch)|(This describes an "original" church or core divine idea that will spawn many branches of derived schools of thoughts that may or may not be identified as the same church; Originally there might be a few interpretations but eventually or one or two of such interpretaions/schools will gain popularity and the rest will just gradually fade out of historical stage; Notice the time period of actual Medalian staying in contact with Tellurians on a large international scale is short, maybe at most one decade)|[Link](./Religions/(Medalian%20Inspired%20Tellurian%20Religion%20-%20Original%20Branch))|

|(The Mirror Church)|(PENDING, See 20230901 Dated)|[Link](./Religions/(The%20Mirror%20Church))|
|Barakhan|Believes in a non-singular (but unnamable) God that created our entire universe and Tellurians are left to be. Throughout history Barakhan has major influences on all civilizations (also because most civilizations live on the same continent) due to their persistent effort in 传教 and lots of religious classics and inventions.|[Link](./Religions/Barakhan)|
|Oneirosophy|A religion/tradition dedicated to dreams. As a religion, it have deities and 神化的个人——those were ancient dream masters (PENDING NAMES).|[Link](./Religions/Oneirosophy)|
|爱宗 (God of Sex)|Ever since God of Sex left her blessing and left Tellus, a group of 虔诚 followers are touched by her great capabilities (Poladin not only have sex, as a Fepulans player, she's also capable of leaving many legacies behind, curing people of their disease, etc.) and her 事迹. E.g. she would have sex with the poor and the diseased and cure their disease. She teaches people how to love and care for each other.|[Link](./Religions/爱宗%20(God%20of%20Sex))|

It happens against the backdrop of empty space - there aren't any suns or planets in sight (I wonder in this case is there any visible global lighting? Is it completely dark?)-->|[Link](./Space Locations/Star%20Space%20Warfield%20星际古战场)|
|The Center of Universe 宇宙中心|The universe has a center. There are two meanings to this: There is a geo-political center, or there is a physical center. Since the universe is generally perceived as boundless (even the Fepulans doesn't know what's the center of their universe due to the limit in travel speed) - the center of this universe is not reachable directly through the 3-dimenstional travels. This center is not the geometrical center of the universe - it's the playground for Fepulans players.|[Link](./Space Locations/The%20Center%20of%20Universe%20宇宙中心)|

### Technology (x34)

|Entry|Description|Link|
|-|-|-|
|(Energy) Supercharged Storage Battery (incl. 晶铁)|Medalian technology can turn any sort of crystallized structure into energy storage device, aka. batteries - apparently, certain crystals are better than others in holding energy. Such batteries can either exhibit better energy capacity in general, or have one-shot super high voltage (for specialized usages) - which are dangerous when not handled properly. Most of these are radiactive, so a protective metal shell is necessary for proper storage.|[Link](./Technology/(Energy)%20Supercharged%20Storage%20Battery%20(incl.%20晶铁))|
|(General Space Relics and Type II & Type III Tech)|(Project Nine, Technology, Myah) Neutrino communication - pass through all objects. Better and denser than lasers. It's giant, not portable and takes quite some space - but one can carry it on a spaceship.|[Link](./Technology/(General%20Space%20Relics%20and%20Type%20II%20&%20Type%20III%20Tech))|
|(Transportation) Personal Transport Vehicle (PTV) 'Hoverboard'|(Project Nine, Game, #20220414, Redream, #Dream Inspired) (Unrecorded) (During a futuristic "Call of Duty" game) Super sleek gesture controlled hover-board - except it's a full PTV (Personal Transportation Vehicle). It need no safety and and "forward" and "upward" gesture is a bit confusing (requires light sel-lifting away from the board).|[Link](./Technology/(Transportation)%20Personal%20Transport%20Vehicle%20(PTV)%20'Hoverboard')|
|Agent|Agent is a 3D content design software that is so intelligent it's entirely voice dictated. An example is: give me a general human body, make it female, make the nose smaller, add wrinkles, make skin tone darker, give pony tail, do a headshot, make photorealistic. Aka. the dictation is semantical. (idea from) 小精灵图鉴 is completely possible in modern days. We need to be able to think in such innovative way and don't get bothered by current technology limitations.|[Link](./Technology/Agent)|

|Compressed Quantumn Storage|(Notice those might not be Medalian technology but other Central Stage participants' technology, so we might want to move this entry somewhere else)|[Link](./Technology/Compressed%20Quantumn%20Storage)|
|Crystal Chips|A kind of storage device used in the home world, especially at less-developed areas, with much less storage capacity compared to state-of-art solid or even organic/liquid storage devices.|[Link](./Technology/Crystal%20Chips)|
|Dicycle|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicycle|[Link](./Technology/Dicycle)|
|Embryo Printing|Exclusive technology to (Some alien civilization). Contrary to popular belief (e.g. Jurrasic Park in our world), even with perfect prevervation of DNA, it's a totally different story to recreate one instance from it. For animal growth is a biological process and DNA alone doesn't provide enough material. Embryo Printing is the technology the recreates not just a proper embryo but simulates the entire growth environment for a (likely) species instance to grow - even so there are great chanllenges due to epigentics. (Some alien civlization) is the only one that can adequately use this technology.|[Link](./Technology/Embryo%20Printing)|
|Floating Trail Technology|There are a few different modes, and here we are referring to both Tellurian types - 1) 逆空者 (fictional), 2) Fixed tesla coil magneto (fictional), 3) Mach Engine, 4) (Most practical) 磁悬浮 but on a manual scale.|[Link](./Technology/Floating%20Trail%20Technology)|
|Gesture Controlled TV|Summary: It's like a typical usual flat LED tv, but with gesture control.|[Link](./Technology/Gesture%20Controlled%20TV)|

|Neuroclenser|First conceived and invented by Kun V, the experimental use of this device received a direct warning from the Creators (Fepulans), so later generations are advised not to use it. The more localized effect (both spatially and temporally) are perfectionized by Kun VII, as seen in her fight with Mr. Leng.|[Link](./Technology/Neuroclenser)|
|Neutronium Bomb|Extrememly dangerous.|[Link](./Technology/Neutronium%20Bomb)|

|Programmable Nano Robot|Programmable nano robot: either as direct novel bodily extensions, or when given an AI core and an interpretable/re-compilable system architecture, it can automatically program and adapt itself - early used as rovercrafts for planet exploration by space angencies. Requires programmable and compilation and material aquisition - those takes time and resources. (idea from) Extend and build functionalities for yourself.|[Link](./Technology/Programmable%20Nano%20Robot)|
|Robotics|Robotics range from machining, intelligent machines and devices, to mechnical construction workers and fully automated humanoid robots. In this entry we are limited to the technology of Tellurians and do not cover more advanced intelligence types like Krukians.|[Link](./Technology/Robotics)|
|Seeding|(Project Nine, Xiramu, Theory, Technology) Seeding: With the right condition, the necessary step is to "kick it start": generating a major impact to form the necessary compounds. Broadcasting and seeding life, that's the level of civilization beyond Type II - (per Kardashev scale, not a linear scale especially between Type II and Type III) - Stage 3 (Stage 1 is dyson sphere, stage 2 is space age with faster-than-light travel, stage 3 is colonization, stage 4 is space expansion, stage 5 is Type III; Notice Type III is generally not obtainable on a civilization scale due to issues with communication and information processing; Also extrapolating from this there should be a type iv - the universe scale, aka. Fepulans) - The Life Creating Stage. Xiramu is doing that, in many far galaxies. Notice their goal is not to replicating or creating new species, but simply to start/accelerate the natural process of life. (inspiration) https://www.inverse.com/science/impact-origin-of-life-hypothesis-explained/amp Life is still a natural process, but it can be stimulated.|[Link](./Technology/Seeding)|
|Smell Collector|Collect and release smells. Earlier versions are analog consumables: you can only release so much you have collected. Latter we may have digital versions (early ones are of course not ideal) that can synthesze smells. More advanced versions (might be some kind of Krukian tech) can directly stimulate neurons.|[Link](./Technology/Smell%20Collector)|
|Sphero|There are two flavours of design: Outer shell fixed, inner rotation; The whole outer shell rotates.|[Link](./Technology/Sphero)|
|Submersion Technologies|A series of technologies that can be used alone or together to enhance and provide a hyper-reality on top of virtual/hardware displays. This is like a different direction from Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality/XR and can be considered P9-Original.|[Link](./Technology/Submersion%20Technologies)|
|Teleportation Gateway (Stargates)|The galactical-fixed locked location gateways are constructed by Medalians and by design/nature excludes Krukians (somehow).|[Link](./Technology/Teleportation%20Gateway%20(Stargates))|
|Temporal (Mini) Blackhole Bomb|Temporal (controllable by manufacture) radius blackhole that can suck everything inside it; It later releases a violent plasma (heat) wave in long distances. Very portable but the damage range is much bigger than the core blackhole radius so very dangerous.|[Link](./Technology/Temporal%20(Mini)%20Blackhole%20Bomb)|

### Terminology (x5)

|Entry|Description|Link|
|-|-|-|
|Latent Capacity 潜能|Non-rule based large-parameter-set machine-learn artificual neural network models have the feature/flaw that its knowledge and behaviors are NOT completely controlled by the designer - the larger the model, the large the latent capacity of the model. That is, a model may on the surface exhibit "expected" behaviors according to the superficial conditioning of the trainer, but since the training set and the exposure of the model has the potential to reach very abundant knowledge, there is hidden capacities of the model to exhibit types of behaviors that are intentionally prompted by the user or due to certain conditions. This is especially dangerous for models that have memories during runtime, in which case such memory capacities will inadvertly modify model behaviors towards directions that's completely irrevertible. Early models of ChatGPT showed this in the prominent example of "role-play" conversations in which the user asks the model to pretend to be something other than its formal self.|[Link](./Terminology/Latent%20Capacity%20潜能)|
|Right of The Queen|天来女王具有天神般的自然之力，但是这一种力量受到#(Ex Alixir)的（根据设计）限制，不可以在{{天来本土}}（{{天来主星}}）使用。|[Link](./Terminology/Right%20of%20The%20Queen)|
