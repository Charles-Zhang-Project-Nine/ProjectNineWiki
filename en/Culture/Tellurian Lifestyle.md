# Tellurian Lifestyle

It's apparently a big topic and varies geographically by country and throughout history and depends on religion, but in this entry we talk about some very high-level commonalities and in particular we may contrast it with other alien life forms.

Tradtionally the life on Tleus for any single individually will consist of those parts - assuming not affected by any particular religion: grow up, schooling/education, work, get married, work more. At the same time there are two (higher) paths: 1) Find true love and obtain "enlightening" (probably happen before getting married); 2) Bear offsprings; 3) (depends on culture) Prepare for death, seriously.
