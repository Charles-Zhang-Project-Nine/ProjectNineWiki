# Medala Naming Culture

Tags: Medala, Culture, Name

Historically, name is just a way for people to identify each other, and it could be as simple as a single word. Gradually, as certain families and identities/groups/glans develop, people start to inherit part of the word and that becomes family name. Other specific names are derived similarly. Some names are used together to collectively represent a "full name", otherwise, certain names are alternatives for identifying the same person and is equivalent to a full name.

In general, (not just Medala, also applies to Tellus) Medalian names are not restricted to Frst Name, Last Name format. More usually people have multiple formal names: family, personal, clan, nickname, pen, artistic name (of all kinds), etc. The name culture in certain Medalian countries (e.g. Konralika) is very extensive.
