# Water Quidditch

Underwater Quidditch: riding fishes. Audience sitting underwater. Or audience can be above water.

## Notes

* By the way, do you know Quidditch is a [real sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(real-life_sport)) now? Populated and standardized by Quidditch World Association. It's not just some fun game that some UofT students come up with. Holding a stick between legs looks dangerous though.
