# Tellus

Tags: Tellus, Planet, Tellus World

(CURRENT TODO) Tellus countries <- Tellus world map re-collection (Star Manager) <- Authoring tool for Tellus <- The Matrix: Planet generator HD (programming)
Tellus is NOT Earth, though there are similarities. The history, biology, anthropology, and origins and biological evolution are all different (though with similarities).

The third/forth planet (closer to the sun I/II) in the Sol-II system, this is the planet where Tellurians live on.

| Type | Planet |
| --- | --- |
| Sub-type | Super Earth |
| Radius | 6,371 Km <!--Same as earth--> |
| Orbit Radius | 149,600,000 Km (149.60 million kilometers) <!--Needs recomputation based on two star model--> |
| Location | Tellus is in the Sol System, which is in CSU. |

<!--Note: For more design-time information, see Star Manager. (Remark, #20221120) Star Manager was no longer a thing; So it's either this Wiki, or RTS?-->

## Names and Etymology

<!--Pending elaboration then we can move part of this into Tellurian repo Etymology folder-->

* The word "Tellus" comes from Greek word for "earth". <!--Pending modifications-->
* Sometimes people (from an outsider's perspective, e.g. Medalians) call the planet Tellus as "Telluria" (特鲁丽亚), per "a place where Tellurians live".
* Notice since Earth is not a proper name in the Project Nine universe, we might want to modify or change this name to make it slightly more distinct. However, I do think something like "Tellus" is good in the sense that it provokes a similarity to "earth", but I might want to avoid "tellus" literally because that just means "earth". E.g. "Teris/Terris" (and people will be called Terisian/Terrisian) is derived from "Tellus" (in the sense that I just made it up) and it's more distinct than Tellus.
* Dahoa: per 20230916 "Project Rebound" "X13 Orbits" conception. See Project Nine scanned sketch.
* Tellus -> Dolan -> Kolan

Other Names:

* Tellus people call themselves: Tellus 地球 (Yes, the correct chinese translation is NOT 泰勒斯but地球? Or maybe we call it 地星?)
* Medalian people call Tellus: 厄古珀 (Escuba) (That-old-thing😂)

## Geography

Tellus is slightly larger than Earth (to accomodate many more magical beings).

## Anthropology

There are three major *"humanoid" species* on Tellus (use latin names directly), two (or more) of them still exist today:

* Tellurian 1 - Archetype : Homo Sapiens <!--Notice we use the English word as is-->; "智人"
* Tellurian 2 - Archetype: Home Erectus <!--Notice we use the English word as is-->; "高地人"
* Other Tellurian Species (Distinct) - Archetype: Homo Sapiens Cavernas/Homo Cavernas (Neanderthal; From Neanderthalensis which is region-specific naming)

All species of Tellurians originate from North Axia.

(I am surprised to see I actually considered the possibility of multiple species, and that's good. And per 20230402 Dev Note, here are the appendix, pending merge: The Tellurian world did not have that part of history that involves a Portkey - they may have some similar hominin siblings in their evolutionary path but things just naturally merges and happens and it's even possible that none of those earlier species were extinct - like the distinct between black and white, they may have simply persisted on Tellus)

### Tellurian ("Humanoid") Species

There are in the modern world 2 major types of tellusoid on Tellus: 高地人和智人。高地人起先在北艾发现，后来分为南方高地人和北方高地人；高地人体格健大，北高地人适应严寒天气、肤色偏白，南高地人适应炎热天气，肤色偏黑——双方互相看不起，冲突矛盾很大，是除了与智人的矛盾之外相互之间最大的矛盾。其中南方高地人在赤道附近的太平洲聚集比较多所以又称平川人（话说所有的人都可能是先在南艾发生）——平川人的地区是上古文明，<!--类似埃及地区尼罗河流域-->其祖先建造了金字塔，位于赤道而农业发达、民风淳朴大方泼辣，有些地方四季都能种植，由于向来精于计算和经商、天文，到了当代则是文化十分发达。

南北高地人是相互之间完全不沟通的——北高地人是共产主义，南高地人是资本主义。其中智人被夹在南北高地人之间。泰勒斯上的冲突主要是西方和中方文化的冲突，自由民主和共产主义的冲突，以及两大人种和南北高地人之间的冲突——冲突并非两极化：类似当今internalization世界，这种冲突是公存互利关系和历史差异之间的冲突。<!--(PENDING) PENDING CONSOLIDATION: Do it in one additional pass (I am running out of time otherwise I will do it now and not link the webpage) - We can take some meanings from those interpretations of the naming of things: https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/16562396.html. No need to otherwise collect that webpage fully. Similarly, refer and re-collect the text on 灌溉、农业发达 of the 平川地区：https://www.sohu.com/a/330874620_100098218.-->

### Racial History

* Long time ago large predator animals dominate the world and since there was never a distinction event (like that happened on our Earth), those large monsters/beasts like dinosours (which are egg-born) still exist till this day. The animal world of Tellus is thus fierce and highly diverse.

The racial difference between T1 and T2 is a long-lasting issue and cause of conflict within the T2 Tellurian species. As in in our world, the other tellurian species (Homo Cavernas) are closest long-distinct species (will be known as Medalians). <!--Notice it's still an open question whether Medalians originate from Earth or are spontaneous creations of the universe-->

There were lots of wars (and continue to be) between most countries because *most conutries inconviniently live on the single the largest continent*.

Homo Sapiens value traditions: oral traditions, labour traditions, and all sorts of things "our ancestors have done for thousands of years" (aka. more like "China"). Home Sapiens are very smart but they just invent things for fun and don't push for the usage and utility of it - they invented everything multiple times, each time with some modifications, more like crafts and never mass-produce things that much because they don't value things mass-produced; While Homo Erectus have "machines for everything" - literally - they have machines even for peeling skins of fruits and crack nuts. Homo Sapiens also criticize Homo Erectus as stealing their inventions (but put into better use).

## Countries & Geo-Politics

(It's also very interesting, once we have a complete map setup, to see which countries have most reserve in which natural resources, through different geographical world map infographics; Before we have that, we might be able to temperarily do that in some Excel setup with only names)

At the moment, in present day, the countries are roughly categorized in those categories: 1) ancient, 2) developed, 3) developing, 4) poor/not-developed, 5) religious, 6) Geo-conflicts, 7) Exotic-styled, 8) city states, and 9) special zones.

Several major international players:

1. ???: The super power of Tellus
2. Pumuna: Immigration country
3. Austinbu 奥心本: Major peaceful immigration country
4. Chinna: Cultural influencer

Several non-international player but nonthless quite note-worthy for historical reasons:

1. Kanit: A very self-isolated socialism country governed by dictator. Later divided into Takensian (The New East, TNE) and Nerssua /Nershua/ (The Old Western Union, Formerlly Union of Visla Socialist Republics/UVSR; This is the larger area of the two after division).

Below sections provides a list of all countries on Tellus. At this moment our major contribution would be: name the countries, provide basic identity information, locate the countries. When we design those countries, instead of pulling reference from a single real country, we can draw from 2-3 real countries/dynasties and from different time periods of each country.

### 1. Ancient Civilizations

Ancient civilizations are no longer a thing, though new countries have developed on the land that was once ancient and glorious.

#### Ancient Glorious Civilizations

* Ancient Balnum: Modeled after ancient Rome/Greek.
* Ancient Eunòir/Lavdi: It's said that this was the gathering places of MANY gods.
* Ancient Hely: Modeled after ancient Egypt + Babylonia.

#### Civilization Lasts Till Present Day

Three nations are distinct that they have long history from the ancient world and their identity still exist as of today:

* (China)
* ???
* (India)

#### Lost Civilizations

Those are the civilizatoins that are once forgotten then re-discovered.

* ???: (Etruscan)
* ???: (Pompeii)
* ???: (Maya)

### 2. Developed Regions

Among all political ideologies, only liberal capitalism and strongly-centrally controlled communism/socialism/dictatorship can lead in the world, and this is contributed by both the economical factor, the amount of population, the amount of available resources, and also the political history of the country.

"Western World":

* Austinbu
* Pumuna

"Eastern World":

* Chinnan
* Satusha (If this was also a developed region then it's very curious to see what those large forces are going to play in the international roles along with "European" capitalism societies)
* (Saudi Arabia): Controller and large exporter of oils
* (???): Controller and large exporter of rare earth elements

### 3. Developing Regions

In terms of political ideologies, there are those few types: 1) Communism, 2) Socialism, 3) Capitalism, 4) Fascism (rare), 5) Marxism, 6) Democracy, 7) Dictatorship, 8) Libertarianism, 9) Modern conservatism, 10) modern liberalism, 11) Anarchism (classical, egoist), 12) Imperialism, 13) Religous.

* Channi
* Kanit
* Qhinna (Chinna)
* Gandi
* Nerssua
* Hanuda
* TNE
* Audas

### 4. Poor Regions

* Ao Dai
* UVSR

### 5. Religious/Magical Regions

* Dume: (famous for some kind of magical power as a nation?)

### 6. Geo-Conflicts 地缘冲突地区

Those are the regions that each claim they are indepedant or in practice they are independant but they are too weak to claim those (like Taiwan), and thus making the 国际社会 hard to tag them.

### 7. Exotic Styled

Call it old-fashioned or impractical, but it's a lifestyle unique.

Notice due to smaller foodprints of those communities, they do not tend to have large impacts to the larger international world - maybe only in terms of smaller cultural and 轻工业/手工业产品, but nothing super pervasive.

#### Tribes and First Nations/People (Aboriginals)

#### Foraging/Nomadic (Non-Civilzied/Non-Urbanized) Communities

A nomad is a member of a community without fixed habitation who regularly moves to and from areas. Such groups include hunter-gatherers, pastoral nomads, tinkers and trader nomads.

Even on Axia there are 民族 that are still largely nomadic or preliminary algricultural forms. Foraging lives (including hunting) are almost gone on Axia, but observed in many first nations in other continents that were less involved throughout world history.

Ereb:

* The Eddics: Ice house, hunting, may also gather undersea plants for food, may have small-scale animal/sea plant farms. I am not sure what/whether they eat for fibers and other green vegetables?

Axia:

* The Nomansans/The Nomans: Nomadic life.
* Felous: Hunters.
* ???: (North, East, and a bit along south-east coast) Traders that fly around in airhsips and live on the sky (or may have land-based establishments e.g. castles) since the (16th) century (4600). Very strong community. Old-styled steampunk and firepowder tech.

#### Sea Life

Since the advent of ships and fishing, and especially since 大航海时代, there have been communities that either live exclusively on the sea, or to a large extent living on seas. I think we should have a word for it.

The term commonly used to describe communities that travel on the sea or rely heavily on fishing is "maritime or seafaring communities." They travel on the sea, or relies largely on fishing and don't live on lands that much. These communities typically have a lifestyle centered around the oceans, rivers, and other bodies of water, depending on fish and other marine resources as their main source of sustenance. Another related term is "aquatic nomads" or "oceanic nomads," which highlights their nomadic lifestyle specifically related to the sea.

* ???: A small/not-so-small group of communities active along Appes Lake/(The middle sea; North-west of Axis) (which connects to the ocean), especially around 350 years ago (abount 18th century in earth calendar, and likely some time around 4700 on Tellus calendar) that are pirates and 洗劫沿岸城市 and escape to the sea; They hire on neighbouring towns and cities or simply 掠夺人口 for training.
* The Wuhans: Sea communities, used to be a large (Viking-like) identity that has both land and sea dwellings; Nowadays considered as pirates by many. Active near Odentis.
* The Hadus/The Handus: Active near the Hanudian Ocean. Have occupations on small islands. Good at metallurgy and forging.
* ???: Active near The Caelestis.
* ???: Active around The Pearl Ocean.

### 8. City States

City states usually have very unique and distinct (political) power sources and religious and historical significance to make it to be the way it is. It's understood that a city state is NOT just formed from economical reasons - though through development it may play significant roles in the economical world. It may due to very unique organization/political schemes, religous reasons, or reasons related to specific 民族.

* NFC: We all know it very well😉
* Soulsar: Modeled after Singapore/+Monaco.
* ???: Modeled after Monaco.
* (Etruscan City): Modeled after Vatican City, follows the teachings of Barakhan religion (or a branch of it).
* ???: A city that was once taken from a large country as 战利品 to the winning country - but like how England and Japan always take care of their captured cities, this city has grown to be a significant player in the world, after its depauture from its original country. Modeled after HongKong before it's returned to China.
* Samesto: An ancient city founded directly in the middle seas by God of Virtue Tissana.

### 9. Special Geo-Zones (Post-War)

Medalians do NOT have stated occupations on Tellus, but Kruks has four "colonies/occupations" on Tellus. Most of them are idle those days but highly dangerous to intruders.

* ???: A base in the Caelestis.
* ???: A base in the Treasure Ocean.
* ???: An occupation in (some poor country) (Axia).
* ???: An occupation in Arphyria.

## Calendar

因为太阳系有8个重要的星体（包括太阳和月亮），所以从古代巴以太人流传下来直到现代历法，每周8天<!---Per Babylon and why there are 7 days in our modern calendar.-->。
纪年历法名称叫做“大纪元”，例如“大纪元5000年“。不过这个名字虽然响亮但是与现实中entity有冲撞而且不是intentional的，所以如果有alternative的话考虑修改。

### Continents

泰勒斯上有六大洲五大洋：<!--(5+1) continents-->

* Axia, which is divided into north and south <!--(艾克西亚)（腓尼基人起名/闪米特语）（艾洲）分为南北: Northern Axia and Southern Axia-->
* Ereb <!--(以拉伯, 以洲)-->
* Arphyria <!--(阿飞利亚洲, 飞洲)-->
* Audas <!--(Latina, 拉丁美洲, 美洲, 奥达洲)-->
* The Occina/Occinica <!--(太平洲/大河洲) - In the middle of the southern sea-->

### Oceans

There are five major oceans on Tellus:

* The Great Northern Ocean - The Caelestis <!--The Heavenly/Mystical Sea-->
* The Great Southern Ocean - The Frozen Sea, The Gledia/Gladia <!--(from latin Gelida)-->
* The Great Western Ocean - Treasure Ocean, The Odentis <!--(from Occidentis)-->
* The Hanudian Ocean: West of southern hemisphere <!--Or "Resic Ocean" in the north of eastern hemisphere (or southern hemisphere)-->
* Pearl Ocean in the east southern hemisphere <!--Or south of eastern hemisphere, or southern hemisphere, or east of southern hemisphere)-->

About 64% of Tellus is water, and the rest 36% consists of continents and islands.

### 泰勒斯世界七大奇迹

1. (Natural/God-made) 神迹花园：沙漠绿洲，禁断空间——强烈扰乱数字信号干扰，无法飞行；可以通过近地卫星观察。
2. (Man-made)  古修特圣城：占地广袤mediterranean/Ethen architecture花园古城宗教圣地奇迹祭坛神庙——类似金字塔和空中花园的结合，关键是保留至今，传闻有神祇庇祐，自身是结界——重合（当地）神界入口。（与Port City属于同一个国家）
3. (Man-made) 长城/长涧（参考沙特的建筑proposal）：建造死很多人
4. (Man-made) 北极水晶宫
5. (Man-made) (Architecture) (Some Tomb)
5. (Man-made) (Architecture) (Some Museum)
5. (Man-made) (Architecture) (Some Statue)
5. (Man-made) (Architecture) (Some Opera House)
5. (Man-made) (Architecture) (The Lighthouse of Alexandria)
5. (Man-made) (Architecture) (Some Public Bath)
5. (Man-made) (City) (Some Stone-Brick City on the Mountains)
5. (God-made/Natural) 世界之脊泰罗山（有很多其他名字：寂寞山，无量山，Alfamo山）
6. (God-made) 
7. (Natural) 世界咽喉：海洋中间无底深洞

## Legends

* (Magic) The first port key actually give rise to ancient Tellurian gods - later we can showcase how 修真者 fight with modern weaponary, with respective advantages and disadvantages. (It’s messy and a weird fantasy at first sight, but we just need to balance things well and focus on the commonality, and come up with a consistent visual style like Final Fantasy)

## Design Notes

In response and as an elaboration to the idea of creating a completely alternative "human" civilization on another "earth" like system and alternative universe. We are bringing live to this "new Earth": temporarily called **Erdi/Terra/Tellus/Mabel** (with the dominant people on it called Tellurians or Terran). Notice Terran is standard sci-fi word for alternative Earth setting.

There is one super-large continent near equator, and three other smaller continents on Tellus. There is no continent on the southern part but there is a small continent on the northern part of the planet. I would envision Tellus roughly the same size as Earth (just with very different continent and climate configurations).

## History/Historical Events

(Last Revision Time: 2023-04-05. Incomplete revision.)

History is about higher level stages from a historian's perspective. The specific date put here is for reference purpose and do not conform to our own P9 universe calendar for Tellus.

* T-1000000000 Age of Giants. Tags: Tellurian World, Tellus. Date: -100:000:000-00-00. Time: 1,000,000 Yr. Long long time ago the Tellus was roamed with giants even bigger than dinosaurs! Dinosaurs were their pets. The ancients are very powerful and to some extent intelligent - they can have immense creative powers (think in terms of Dwarf Fortress but much bigger characters). They have text records! Carved on bones of giant ancient animals.
    * The Age of Giants ended with a climate change - caused scarcity of food. Maybe even at the same time of fierce continental drifts and terra-reformulations.
    * Consider putting this under history of Tellus under Tellus wiki entry.
    * (Note) This might denote the "mytical age", and such ancient texts are believed to record "secrets" to long and powerful lives.
    * (Remark, #20230326) Per latest remark on Magical reality, Tellus very likely have evolved highly intelligent and magic-wielding animals since long time ago. And if that's the case, lots of human labours will have new innovative ways to be carried by animals, and different kinds of human-animal relationship will form. Though human's utilization of magic per se can still be very rudimentary, compared to Medalians.
* T5001 Total War. Tags: War and Conflicts. Date: 2002-12-28. Keywords: Kun VII, Total War, WWIII. Kun VII arrived, Earth union against Kruks, Total War - WWIII. 
    * (Note) (Maybe call it "The Noble War" or "The Re-United War"?) It's important to note that humans will be divided as long as there is differences in values and culture, which is very likely to continue last for at least a few thousand years unless space age comes much earlier.
    * (Note) Also governmental control of all countries will be tightened during this period but there will be contradicting voices especially in liberal countries like during the COVID pandemic.
* Arising of Simple Life Forms. Tags: Fepulans World. Keywords: Experiment. ProtoOrder: -960000. **The Outer World (1250KYA (Earth Time))**: After observing the universe for a long time and discovering some initial simple life forms here and there, the Creators (the main research team) start experimenting with understanding the formation and design of those life forms:
    1. They make experiments on local life form planets;
    2. They synthesize life forms based on observations;
    3. They start generating "strange matter" based life forms here and there in the universe.
    * (Originally they thought their expanding universe are making their fate unrelated to any other part of the universe, latter they discover that they are actually on the BACKTRACT of the inverse of a collapsing universe - they are likely inside a black-hole like construct whose timeline is actually flowing backwards, as such, their communication with the simulated universe actually happens out of sync; How time exactly works there is still a myth to me)

* 3000.08.05 The Medieval Times. Tags: Our World. Time: 450 yr. The Medieval time is filled with anger, fear, uncertainty, tormented by wars, dark magic and wizzadry.
* 4150.02.15 Rapid Technological Development and Modern Wars. Tags: Our World. Time: 350 yr. During this time of rapid technological leap, industrial scaling up, wars and conflicts are the severest before global internationalization.
* 4467.03.09 First Test of Nuclear Bomb. Tags: Our World, War. The first nuclear bomb was tested during this period of rapid development of technology and science.
    * (Note) Likely catalysis is the tense relationship between countries.
* 4472.12.15 First Test of Large-Scale Matomical Weapon. Tags: Our World. The massively-destructive matomical weapon is tested, only 5 years after the first nuclear bomb was tested.
* 4670.09.12 Arrival of Miah. Tags: Harmony, Era=Intergalactic Age. Keywords: Some related items pending elaboration: Internet, Miah, Social Media, Medalian, Alien, Canada, Toronto, Diplomacy. First public **Medalian** exposure to general public in the **Internet**. General public consensus to invite Medalians on Earth. Treaty with Canada to land near Toronto.
    * Timing: The only crucial constraint regarding the timing of this event is it must happen during the adolescence of Tao Ye - ideally when he's at school age.
* 4672.06.26 Arrival of Kruks. Tags: Our World, Kruk World. Accompanied by the astroid rain, Kruks are sending its batches of "testing-armies" to earth (through some kind of short-distance portal mechanism) - the majority of their troops are at the edge of the Sol system.
    * (Note) As illustrated in **Canonical Minicore** - this event happens at the graduation party of a main character. The season is just starting to enter **Summer**. Prior to this, Miah has already made formal acquaintance with Tellurians.
    * (Note) This is not the entire Kruks (most Kruks, especially the *subclasses* won't even come), but *an early troop of one of a politically/religiously extremist group of Kruks* (and some other similar subclasses will come). Maybe not the **collectives**, because Collectives like to mind their own business - this is the **Classical Kruks**.
* 4672.08.05 Astroid Rain Event. Tags: Our World, Kruk World. At the beginning of summer, there are lots of gravity-affected deviation of astroids from the outer belt sending towards earth and thus causing magnificent **astroid rain**.
    * (Note) This is related to Kruks invasion.
    * (Note) I think it makes (more) sense to say that this is not an isolated event - astroid rain is becoming more frequent than earlier years early in the year, and people were originally suspecting it's merely astroid events, but it's caused by Kruks behaviors. This culminates in the Kruks' formal invasion.
* 4672.08.10 The Junior Graduation Gathering. Tags: Tao Ye. Amid the Astroid Rain events, it's the arranged grand gathering party for Charles and his friends..
    * (Note) Originally I was thinking it's the prom, but we must made clear the immigration relationships of those Tellurian people. But it's not necessarily important whether we import this (real-world) western prom culture - the key extraction here is the craziness of such a gathering event where lots of kids drink and went wild (even including sex and drug) and spending lots of money on expensive cars and dresses.
* 4700.06.25 Discovery of Continent XXX. Tags: Tellurian World. Date: 4700-06-25 # New calendar per Tellus rather than per deprecated Earth. Time: 350 Yr. The discovery of ??? spir a new wave of continental exploration and leads to the formation of a quickly-rising force: the country of ???, which later become the second-to-Chinna major player on the international playground.

    * (Remark) Consider move to entity specific Wiki entry.
* 2012.05.05 Rapid CofN Dev. (2012-2032). Tags: NFC. Time: 20 Yr. Various levels and peripherals of the city getting done in order.

    * Consider moving to character specific wiki entry.
* 2045.05.07 Miah Arrived with Kun VI. Tags: Medalian World. In year 2045, Miah arrived with **Kun VI**, there are two scenarios depending on the thread of development I am taking.
    * **Scenario 1: There will be another war**: This time intending to claim the final victory of Earth against the competition with **Kruks** AND to add to the conflict after finally getting the news far across the galaxy, **Xiram**. The war this time is much more intricate, with battlefields prepared by all forces: countries on earth, CofN itself led by Mr. Leng, habitant Kruks and Miah on earth, and various surrounding satellites and planet colonies. We might as well blow up the moon this time <!--What’s the consequence of this besides we no longer have tides? Maybe it will have devastating consequences on fishing population? Charles.Zhang, 12/29/2021-->. Hence starts not just the second war, but the **total space age** of terrains (elevated later by the need to find those species after they are gone again, per **Drone 2055**) - this is marked (as the start or the end?) by the subsequent events of both Xiao Kan and (especially due to her popularity) the abduction of Eleven Baker. Earthlings formed their own states union, **The Syndicate Confederation**, *with the help of Miah*, intending to protect itself. <!--(Remark) The issue here is I don’t quite understand how this war could have happened? What’s Xiram coming here for?-->
    * **Scenario 2: Kun is here to bring peace**: Originally this trip’s goal for Kun VI is to: investigate the cause of losing communication from the last expedition, while avoiding potential danger caused by the Kruks.
* 2046.05.07 Abduction of Eleven Baker. Tags: #Our World. Xiao Kan and many others were also abducted during this time; But Eleven was the focus of the public.

### Medalian Arrival

* 1993.02.08 First Miah Contact with Govt. Tags: #Peace, #Prosperity. Keywords: Government. ProtoOrder: -99. Earlier **Medalian** contact with local Earth governments.
* 1996.08.22 Opening of the 1st Medl School. Tags: #Peace. Keywords: Miah, Medalian, Whisper, Toronto, Government. ProtoOrder: -49. First **Medalian school** - first branch of **Whisper** was opened in **Toronto**, facilitating learning exchange to selected first wave of students; Public draw of enrollment was offered by the government.
* 1999.09.15 Troubled Politics. Tags: #War and Conflicts. Keywords: Kruks, Miah. Kruks causing trouble in middle east and some other countries that didn't accept the opening to Miah; Miah request to help was declined.
* 2000.11.23 Kruks forces escalated. Tags: #War and Conflicts. Keywords: Kruks, Miah, Vancouver, Canada. Kruks forces escalated, suspicion and distruct against Medalian species. Assault in Vancouver. Miah defence was limited and massive destruction weapons was not an option.
* 2001.08.06 Miah Withdrawl before TW. Tags: #War and Conflicts. Keywords: Miah, Canada, Kruks. **Miah** withdraw from Earth, **Canada** fell to **Kruks**. Cruel politics.
* 2003.01.01 The Almost Reset Event 清零. Tags: #War and Conflicts. ProtoOrder: 5. The incidence when Kirin almost "reset" the whole history with Neuroclenser. 
    * We can think of it as activating this weapon can take too much power and is extremely dangerous. The first time Kun V did it even Fepulans are alerted and warned them if they dare do it again they will terminate this universe immediately.
* 2003.01.22 Kruks are eliminated. Tags: Kruk World, Kruks. Kruks are eliminated and pushed back to limited areas. (remark, #20230326) It's not possible to completely "eliminate" Kruks.

* Waves of Kruk Invasion: <!--Pending archive as #deprecated-->~~The first wave of **Kruks** invading and coming at Miah *made humans cautious and overly suspicious*. Eventually Miah is driven out of the Earth upon pressure - this is where **The Great War** begins (it's great because it made us realize how small we truly are) - it's barely an equal fight since Kruks have total dominance, but there is severe struggle and resistance.~~ <!--Pending archive as #deprecated-->~~Two Nukes, among others elsewhere, landed on **Vancouver** and **Toronto**. There was a **total nuclear war** and *the planet is wasted beyond recognition* - it leaves us with a *post-apocalyptic world*. <!--Can we settle on how many years did the total war last?-->~~ <!--TODO: Pending reconciliation of exact order of events between Miah and Kruk species arriving on earth; Order of events for Queen Six and Queen Seven.-->

* T4996.05: Miah Started Trading with some countries on tellus.
* T4996.06: Miah Starts Construction of Point-to-Point Gateway at Sol. (overview) This particular stargate might establish a one-point gateway connecting directly to the safe zone under the Medalian control to avoid potential issues of other civilization invasion (and avoid Kruks using it). Due to alignment issues, this particular gateway might be only only certain times at certain years connecting to Doma. (overview) At other times, this gateway might function as a single-way out-only gateway and do not accept incoming transmission and won't broadcast its location. If this is the case, then it's possible that neither Eleven Baker nor Xiao Kan ever made to Doma on their first trip.

* T4997.11: Tao Ye Was Accepted to A Foster Facility.
* T4998.01: Tao Ye Was Adopted and Moved To Live with Zarna and Doita. (discussion) It's a bad idea (originall conceived) to consider Tao Ye as a ""study subject"" of Zarna - not necessary for Miah people at all, and not civlized enough for such an advanced species - they should have greater emphathy and should less objectify human lives. In the latest development, Zarna and Tao Ye are actual (might be united by politics) family members.

* T5027: Aa Mu's Brother went to (NFC) for Career. (note) Aa Mu's Brother Deal with All Kinds of Deals Related to Human Trafficking in the Outer Galaxy (and some of it at hometown before going to outer space).
* T5030.04: Aa Mu Got Lost and Met Xiao Hena. Tag: Xiao Hena, Aa Mu. (note) At this time Xiao Hena is still in a relationship with Gao Cong - so they are both NOT at NFC at this time; However, NFC may have already been (at least partially) built at this time. (note) Since NFC is in Chinna, and since it's more convinient for Xiao Hena to move to a different city than moving into a completely different country - most likely *the city she is in right now is still somewhere in Chinna - maybe at the east coast*. (note) However, notice that as the event ""阿木进城"" goes - the city MUST be NFC, that's how the whole crystal charges make sense. And we are pretty sure Aa My met the "boyfriend" of Hena - and ideally that is indeed Gao Cong. <!--The Canonical Minicore's depiction indeed uses NFC and Aa Mu indeed met Gao Cong and Xiao Hena there; The conflict here is that I wonder what happens when Xiao Hena breaks up with Gao Cong - it looks it's not easy to make it such that Xiao Hena leaves the city she was living in because in the end we do want Hena to live in NFC; So the only option is that Gao Cong is the one that leaves the city, likely be banished for his wrongdoings.-->

* T5034.02: Catherine Become A Recognized Member of TLO. "5 Yr". Tag: Catherine Leng. (overview) The process took 5 years.
* T5035.06: Eleven Baker's Celebration Party. Tag: Eleven Baker. (note) <!--Maybe it's Eleven's publisher that sold her because when she leaves Tellus there is practically no value of her to the corp; And instead of paying the expensive space travel funding, they can just make a false promise and instead of spending money they actually gain money by sell her to some space agencies. We must question can a publisher be so evil? Maybe not - but they can be very CARELESS (maybe intentionally) - so what they did is they find some interstellar agencies (or such agencies found them) and made a deal, assuming/pretending that this agency will take care of Eleven - to sort of make her as the new pop-star of a distant galaxy, and sold her contract. In fact, this can be made even explicit and to the public as a way to further clear off the responsibilities: the three parties including Eleven Baker, the original publisher, and the new agency signed a deal, transferring Eleven's contract from Tellus to some distant galaxy, and they make it a big news that Eleven will now seek new career development in a new distant galaxy. What is NOT public is that the original publisher/agency actually received a large amounts of bonus (bribe) money from this out-of-no-where space talen-acquisition agency. Medai does all the work of shaping such a positive image: it's all adversisement, because seriously, how would Tellurian people ever know whether this space agency is legit at all?! They don't, and that's where everyone is so hyped and careless. One thing we must do before make this idea final: Check the status of Miah regulation on such illicit acitivites on Tellus - are their regulation at all since Miah people has absolutely no soverignty on Tellus and Tellurian governments knows absolutely shit about Medalian world?--> (note) <!--Above along with all the celebration details of the party, some depiction of personal life and emotional background of Eleven Baker, and coverage of media can be made into a single chapter: The Party.-->
* T5035.09: Eleven Leaving Tellus.
* T5036: (People name) 勾结敌国. Tag 张鹤 高聪 TNE. (discuss) What is the need for TNE to do this? What's the use of abundant human slavery? It can't boldly just use those. (The only plausible reason is not that it reflects the need of the country as a whole - but is merely a result of internal government corruption and how such trades benefits the few/many government officials by allowing it to happen and even encouraging it, e.g. monetarily or sexually). (note) It might be around this time when Aa Mu's brother was sent to outer space.

How can she become successful and famous in such feirce world if she's stupid? ¶Maybe her mother helped her too much? I am thinking either Eleven or her mother is actually a very strong and special woman, or both of them. ¶How was Eleven sent out when Stargates are shut down due to Kun VII's leaving? (note) It's possible that the Sol gateway might function as a single-way out-only gateway and do not accept incoming transmission and won't broadcast its location. And that neither Eleven Baker nor Xiao Kan ever made to Doma on their first trip.

## Mythology

Tellus, or the Sol I/II system is located within the Milky Way, which is near middle of the center stage of the universe.

## The Map Project

Once we have complete "present-day" country or geographical regions, we can start drafting some maps to provide overview of inforgraphics, or simply tables, something like this page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_proven_oil_reserves#Countries

Here are the few types of information of interest on the country level:

* Oil and gas reserves and prouctions, also imports and exports
* Rare earth element reserves and prouctions, also imports and exports
* GDP and GDP per capita
* Forest
* Green gas emission
* Population
* Education Level (total degrees per population on primary, secondary, college, university, postgraduate, PhD)
