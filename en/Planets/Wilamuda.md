This is the planet between Puma and Ids in the Doma System.

## Naming and Etymology

* "The Middle Planet": From MV1 we have wilo + lamuda, however this is not going to work (mostly because the portmanteau of those two words are not cool) - ideally we must fall to MV2 or single YY based combinations, which we haven't got a chance to define yet.
