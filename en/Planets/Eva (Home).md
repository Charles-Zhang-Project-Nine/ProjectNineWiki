# Eva (The Original Place) - THE ORIGINATING PLANET (Ancestry Planet) ("Home Planet" - though it's confusing so we don't use this term anymore)

Tags: Medalian, Medalian World

(PENDING INVESTIGATION AND NODES ON EVA'S PLANETARY SYSTEM FORMULATION)

Great bio-diversity, lots of (tame) large land animals (they never had an extinction event for their dinosaurs). Home of Neputalis people. The planet Eva is ~~outside~~ WITHIN central stage of the universe (but as a protected region!). The planet is almost full-year spring all over the place (I am not sure how this is possible yet) with large flat lands and lots of fresh water, abundant green lives. For notes on native Evian people, see entry on Neputalis.

Comments:

* (Remark, #20230629) By "Home Planet", do you mean the home of Medalian civilization (aka. Ids), or the originating planet of the Medalian species ancestry? I am going to take it to mean the "originating planet". (Comment, #20230831) Yeah, as of today the semantics of "home planet" (for Medalians) is referring to their originating place, aka. Eva, which is different from Ids, where their civilization develops.

## Naming and Etymology

* Himuba -> Eva
* Eva should mean something like (taking the quality rather than the vision of) "heaven" because this planet and its surrounding ecosystem (aka. other planets in the system) is teeming with rudimantary life and there is very little competition or survival challenge to the Evian people.
* The world "eva" is Medalian, because it's Medalians that names this planet.

Comments

* (Earlier Time, idea) (Likely commented on #20230402) Actually it's sort of fun if Medalian's ancestry planet IS called "Earth" - just like our Earth😂 So Medalian is still our siblings but we are not a part of the P9 novel at all (instead, we talk about NFC)! (Comment, #20230831) No.

## ~~(Earth)~~

<!-- A lot of concepts below are pending re-collection or indexing at appropriate locations (e.g. Wiki), e.g. what is the Central Stage? -->

As matters goes on earth - half a million years ago, there were two dominant hominid species on the blue marble planet Earth in a distant forgotten galaxy in the universe: **Neanderthals** and **Homo Sapiens**. Among Neanderthals, there were a major tribe named **Angston** (which also exists on Ids when they are moved there).
In year *578,600BC*, an artifact appeared on the surface of Earth, causing major flood and disaster. Eventually when things settled, *the two groups fighted for the control of the artifact*. In the end, Neanderthals win. With the activation of the artifact, the majority of the surrounding Neanderthals were teleported to **the Central Stage of the Universe** (the *non-geometrical center* of the universe), competing with the *other six civilizations* who were blessed/doomed with the existence of such a powerful object. The rest of Neanderthals remaining on earth mated with Homo Sapiens and formed the foundations of humans today.

Five hundred thousand years later, **Medalians** have become a major factor in the Central Stage, and they are coming back to *seek a resolution*. Accidentally, they come across a very similar planet named Tellus on their way. Soon they identified this is NOT their home. The Miah's passing-by/arrival on Tellus is **peaceful and welcoming** - they approached our civilization *courteously and methodologically*. The original stated intention was to establish *trading* and *exchange of knowledge*. <!--(Comment, #20230402) Metaphysically, it's more fun if the goal were not so clear on Tellus. So we let it be that it's on their way to finding their true counterpart that the Medalians just happen to come across Tellus - and they have no intention to disturb this peaceful and 落后的 planet, while Kruks don't agree and due to (some of) their 顽劣 nature, they just wish to disturb and cause chaos - it's at then Myah stand in the way trying to stop/help) This way the Medalians are mostly isolated as a species and independent from Humans. The key idea is that, to the Medalians, Tellurians are NOT significant at all because they weren't even set to visit Tellus. This not only makes more sense from a more superior species' perspective but also fits well the original perception on Medalian's altitude to humans from earlier dreams, AND Medalian's love/hate relationship is just like that of humans and their lost ancestors - so when this would be brought up they can understand each others' feeling about this. What's their intention if they were actually find Earth is another topic, but I think it's a mixture of uncertainty and expectation.--> A whole **Interstellar Trading Route**, named **Craft/Fortune/Belief/Spice/Monads Route** <!--or "Aerospace Connection Route"? Should name after some popular trading goods.-->, is established during this multi-century-long expedition. A derivation of which is later becoming the infamous *Human Trafficking Route*.

<!--(Comment, #20230402) This part needs change. If they were at their final destination it makes sense to build those things but if it's another stranger civilization's territory they might want to approach with more caution because this sounds pretty intrusive.--> On their way to near-Tellus through the Sol System, Medalians built a few **bases on moons of (Saturn) and (Mars)**, and on the visible side of the surface (on Earth) of moon <!--You can sorta see it with a good enough telescope-->. Miahs established the first **Whisper** school in **(Toronto)**.
