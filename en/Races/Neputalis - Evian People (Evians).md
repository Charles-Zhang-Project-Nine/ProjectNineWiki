# Neputalis - Evian People (Evians)

Tags: Eva, #Favorite

(NOTICE THE CONSTRUCT OF TELLURIANS IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM REAL EARTH HUMANS, AND THE ENTIRE ANTHROPOLOGICAL HISTORY OF HOMO SAPIENS IS APPLIED TO MEDALIANS INSTEAD OF ON TELLUS; TO AVOID POTENTIAL CONFUSION, WE WILL NOT USE THE TERM HOMO SAPIENS IN EITHER ENVIRONMENT)

Evian is the first-ever self-originated original intelligent life form that's found by the Fepulans, among many other original life forms and inteligent life forms sprouting among the Simulatione at roughly the same time. Since Eva is outside central stage of the universe, this land is untamed by Fepulans players and other unnatural powers. They are either carbon or silicone based with average height of 2.5-3 meters and looks nothing like typical humans/tellurians. However, they are also bipedal. Their exotic look gives a sense of mystery to the Tellurians. Their body is rather slim/thin but they move fast.
One of its modern-day sibling species is the ancestor of modern day Medalian people.

Neputalis do not eat meat, and their diet is plant based. In fact, I don't even believe their digestive system contains meat-digesting enzymes so eating meat will probably upset their stomach and make them sick, also it smells bad to them.

Throughout the millions of years (specifically, 5 million years) history of biological evolution and Fepulans experimental selections, many different threads of racial development were formed, with the first originaing ancestor of (A. romidus). The first modern-day people-like species was (homo erectus) that was developed around 200K years ago. Due to lack of divine intervention/enlightenment (there was never the sghting of saints), this civilization never went superbly far and is largely barbarial despite high intelligence compared to other land animals.

The planet eva is way too peaceful and comfortable, and the people living there are not challenged much, which hurdles their development.

## Naming and Etymology

* Evian, from Eva
* Neputalis

## Biology

* (Idea) They have different body temperature (slightly higher than human), different hearing range (10-20 times wider than human), different viewing frequency (two-polarity instead of a continuum?).
* (sex, appearance, physique) They have tall, strong, slim, well built body with dark, brown, reddish, smooth and shinny skin (like Latin american). Besides basic sexual-arousal parts, the most private parts of both men and women is their hands - they almost wear gloves at all occasions except at home and with friends, and the most exposed in public is gloves without finger covers. Kirin has long shinny golden hair and browny eyes, while Kun has ocean-blue eyes and purple hair (likely dyed rather than natural) or otherwise black hair roots, both with blood-red lips. For armours, the most important parts are heart armour, arms, stomach/belly, legs - naturally women would need to control the movement of their breasts. The gender difference between men and women is very pronouced as shown in body shape.
