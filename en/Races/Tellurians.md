# Tellurians (Homo Sapiens) (Humans)

Tags: Race, People, Tellus, Fepulans Player

(NOTICE THE CONSTRUCT OF TELLURIANS IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM REAL EARTH HUMANS, AND THE ENTIRE ANTHROPOLOGICAL HISTORY OF HOMO SAPIENS IS APPLIED TO MEDALIANS INSTEAD OF ON TELLUS; TO AVOID POTENTIAL CONFUSION, WE WILL NOT USE THE TERM HOMO SAPIENS IN EITHER ENVIRONMENT; IN FACT, WE SHOULD AVOID REFER TO TELLURIANS AS HUMANS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT EXACTLY HUMANS - TELLURIANS ARE NPCs CONSTRUCTED BY AND FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF FEPULANS PLAYERS)

Tellurians are smaller-version of Fepulans Players made by Fepulans Players as an in-world visitor gathering location among many others, with average height around 1.6-1.7m. The central stage of the universe is teeming with human-like life beings. Tellurians are NOT the same as humans (earthlings), which are originated from Earth in Milky Way. Tellurians are indeed carbon based and bipedal and have some other similar traits of humans.

Before we dive into more detailed and scientific description of the species, here are some sterotypical or exemplifying extremes of body types and possibilities with Tellurian people: 1) Think of NFC Level 1 众食堂 big bulky individuals eating lush food (and this is a highly stylized image); 2) PENDING MORE.

Due to the nature of this post-construction reality, THERE IS NO ARCHAOLOGICAL EVIDENCE of human forms before the first (homo sapiens). THERE IS NOT EVEN SUCH THINGS AS MONKEYS OR chimpanzees on TELLUS! The earlier pre-civilization period life forms are dinosours and other typical lives as found on earth, plus many magical variations. It's great archaological evidence and debate that humans are "created/placed" by gods, but unfortunately to the Tellurians they are at a sad-dharma-vipralopa/the-end-world as modern time, and they lack solid contact with Fepulans players these days.

## Technology

Tellurians has priviledged technology of quantumn computer (various implementations). Per Quantum Supremacy by Michio Kaku (he's a bad guy in the literacy, so we might want to come up with a fictional substitue, e.g. Quantum Primacy by Macho Barn). The development of quantum computing allows them to solve all kinds of problems when resources permitted. That is, Medalians (and Krukians) DO NOT possess such technology.
Tellurians was once close to possess artificial intelligence but due to the fear of Krukians and efforts of lobbying parts and renderings of media, people got afraid and urged the government to not pursue development in this path - same fate with embryo technology.
