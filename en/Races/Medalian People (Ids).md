# Medalian People (Ids)

Tags: Race, Medalian World, Medala

(This entry is about the Medalian race/races or Medalian people, it concerns only biological cyberntical features for Medalian civilization, see "Medala")
(This entry is about the Medalian race as observed on Ids, and it's NOT about the evolutionary history of Evian People)
(PENDING ACADEMIA NAME)

(Ids is large but is half-finished planet and its environment is challenging which shapes both the biological evolution and culture of medalian people significantly)

(Since modern-day, the evolution of Medalian people is 30% biological and evolution and 70% artificial selection/breeding/eugenics/human husbandary/technological evolution, with the development of Kruks as the hullmark)

## Biology

Hereby we record biologies differ from base genus.

* (Idea) Per canonical minocore: Their skin color reflects different magical properties due to harsh environment, and their skin color is affected by mood.
* (Per calendar and number system) Medlian people 4 fingers. Count max to 9 using a single hand, use 8-base in computers.

Blood color: Blue.

## Medalian Ancestry (Medalian Species Background)

(CURRENT TODO) `[Wiki] Notes recollection on Medalian ancestry: part 4/4` <- Medalian world background: Medalian Ancestry (This piece) <- Full text search and recollect on "Central Stage of Universe" <- Ancestry Planet (Eva) (Wiki: Eva)

(From OUTSIDE Doma perspective, on THE ORIGINATING PLANET) Half a million years ago, there were two dominant human species: (Neanderthals) and (Homo Sapiens). Among Neanderthals, there were a major tribe named Angston. In year 578600BC, an artifact appeared on the surface of Earth, and the two groups fighted for the control of the artifact. In the end, Neanderthals win. With the activation of the artifact, the majority of the surronding Neanderthals were teleported to the Central Stage of the Universe, competing with the other 6 civilizations who were blessed/doomed with the existence of such a powerful object. The rest of Neanderthals remaining on earth mated with Home Sapiens and formed the foundations for humans today. Five hundred thousand years later, Medalians have become a major factor in the Central Stage, and they are coming back to seek a resolution.

(design, style) When drawing/picturing Medalians, just imagine them JUST as humans (of all kinds) with some selectived exaggerated body features), no need to picture them as descents of Neanderthals. Especially skin color - we should avoid anything unnatural in our world - no green or blue on humanoids. The only possibility is a trend towards pale yellow and deep reddish. (There is a subculture called "Reddish" describing the favour of those towards people of this origin)
(remark) The purpose of the Creator is to forge a solution - this universe is a simulator, a seed for an ultimate intelligence (not necessarily an individual), and AN ONLINE GAME. The other parts of the universe can seem VERY VERY WILD with all kinds of aliens and stuff and Actors/Travellers. This is a platform for them to seek the ultimate solution for them own imminent problem.
