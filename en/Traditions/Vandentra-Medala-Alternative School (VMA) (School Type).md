It's also called Shwangchwan Education, named after the first headmaster of the original Vandentra-Medala-Alternative School established in (North York) (a district of Vandentra).

## Naming and Etymology

Original proto-name was "Waldorf-Medala-Alternative School" which combines the meanins of Waldorf education (a holistic approach), Medalian origin and alternative school type (as a substitute to ordinary primary and secondary education). The word "Waldorf" in "Waldorf education" refers to the Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory in Stuttgart, Germany. The first school based on this educational philosophy was established in 1919 for the children of the workers of the Waldorf-Astoria factory. The name "Waldorf" has since become associated with this particular educational approach. For that reason, since Waldorf is a location, we will use the name of the location for the first appearance of this school.

The proto-origin for first appearance of this school is "Toronto", which in the world of nowadays Tellus is Vandentra. A shorter form of this education is named after the first headmaster.
