(NOTICE THAT THE CANONICAL NEVER TALKED ABOUT WHETHRE OR NOT THEY EVENTUALLY MADE TO EVA)
(PENDING A BRIEF INTRO/CONNECTION ON THE HISTORY/MOTIVATION FOR THE GREAT EXPEDITION AND MISSIONS OF VARIOUS QUEENS - RELATE THIS TO THE HISTORY BETWEEN MEDALIANS AND KRUKIANS AND THE INVENTION AND GREAT EXPENSE AT MAINTAINING THE QUEENS)

(The Great Expedition) is the historicla event when Medalian people travel across the galaxy towards Eva. This event has a time span of over 500 years or even longer. There are two main purposes of this trip: 1) To eliminate the invading alien civilization; 2) To visit the originating planet. More broadly speaking, because this is a large scale cross-country cross-desciplinary large maneuver, there are a wide variety of purposes for the participants of this trip. On the civilization level, those five asepcts are the main goals: in terms of culture, economy, religion, politics/technology and science.

1. (Culture) To learn, influence, and exchange information with other civilizations;
2. (Economy) To establish trading and even alliances with other civilizations;
3. (Religion/Polotics) To visit the origin of Medalian ancestry and learn more about their past; It's politics per 当权者 aka. Ora Sham Delin's person need to escape Medalian governance and seeking a greater freedom;
4. (Politics/Economy/Technology) To establish influence in the surronding area and along the travel route; And to build star gates along the route;
5. (Science) To learn the unknown of the universe.
6. (Politics/Security) To eliminate the invading sapiens (四足) like civilization (kind of like a revenge but more due to rationale consideration of civilization security), and identify all colonies (or maybe this is a split between Medalian and Krukian ideals).

There were major propaganda campaigns surrounding the "visiting the originating planet Eva" before finalizing and announcing the expedition plan and prior to expedition team departure. Personally to Ora Sham Delin, this is her chance to leave Doma forever.

The expedition team consists mostly of those types of travellers:

* Queen and Queen's followers and Queen's private scout and Queen's private army and Queen's direct commanders
* Medalian governent officials, Medalian (Konralika) Military
* Special expedition operating team
* The expedition team is heavily equipped with a dedicated twin-ship with heavy industrial and military capacities for the purpose of protection and aggressive combats; For convinience of space travel, that twin ship is a part of the overall expedition ship, connected together but functions and is managed seperately (it could also be implemented as a seperate ship, in which case the military ship will always travel first and maybe even constract the star gates, then the civilian ship will follow course)
* Flight attendant crews, including wide range of operational personnels
* Members of the Church - missionaries and pastors;
* Rich travellers who just want to spend the rest of their life outside of Ids (Some of them may settle along the way)
* Along the way, new crews may join and some may leave, either to paths along the route, or go back to Doma system.
* On their way to Eva, a few civilizations or stellar tribes heard about them, interacted with them, or traded with them, and formed a fellowship group and formed a fleet with the mothership.

## Naming and Etymology

For this kind of expedition, the general naming rule is either to give it a codename, which could be of any flavour; Or name it after the lead people/purpose/activity/transport/destination.

* Named as "The Great Expedition" due to lack of a better and more memorizable name.

## Outcomes

> The view of various astronomical objects during a space trip might be stunning, if we do manage to see anything (maybe with the help of some kind of special filter glass).

The travel starts from Pescus, the home galaxy of Medalian, all the way deep into The Cental Stage of the universe (then unknown to Medalian people), passing through 4 galaxies and over 500 years, stopping at Telus in X13. The main expedition team never made it to Eva, and the plan is halted for the forseeable future. However, it's said that Ora Sham Delin led the rest of the crews she brought with her to the edge of Btum. Below is the sequence of galaxies that the trip passes through, notice that technically it's not clear to say "galaxy" for galaxies are intermixed with galaxy groups and globular cluster/nebulas/planetary nebula so the boundary may not be crystal clear:

1. (NGC 7582/Medalian-Local Galactic Group) Pescus
2. (Earth-local Galactic Group) The Milky Way: Just a quick pass through. Didn't passthrough Andromeda but did kind of pass by it since it's near The Milky Way.
3. (NGC5128/M101/Ganes Group) ???/Messier 87 (We need this one more for the fleet to gathre more followers)
4. (CSU/(Virgo Cluster)) Exvatum: Encounter with Tellus; Discovering of CSU.
5. (CSU/(Virgo Cluster)) Btum - Escaped Ora Sham Delin and her crews; The rest of the (main expedition) team never made to Eva or Btum.

Economical impacts:

1. Once they have constructed a Gateway, some people can come back to Doma and others can come onto the ship from Doma
2. An interstellar trade path is established, along with the treatise for using it
3. Establishment of extraterestial mining sites and trading depots
4. (What are unexpecte/surprising outcomes?)

Additional outcomes:

* The combat and elimination of the invading enemy civilization colonies left lots of ruins and remains for space exploration and also created quite some enemies and allies.
