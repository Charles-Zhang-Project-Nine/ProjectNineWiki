# Denial of Leng Family's Dominance Role 对于冷家的抗议

Tags: #Canonical, #Draft, Event, NFC, Tellus, Leng Family, Xia Chengnan, Catherine Leng, Tao Ye, Mr. Leng

(THIS SHOULD BE WRITTEN INTO AS PART OF CANONICAL)

The absolute rule of Leng Family is an undeniable fact and act of respect and appreciation from the time of NFC's establishment. This heated argument is much as why the UK still has the throne. But like anything that is a result of historical effort - as time passes by, feelings and memory of the remote gets faded away, and latter generations or even within the same generation do not appreciate that significance of the event. But that's the quirk of a democracy government: the overall function of people is what really matters, even if we have strong opinions on what is right and what is wrong. As such, a strong opinion is nothing more than something that requires a bit more debate to push down - nonthless, with proper organization, any social movement should be able to carry in this city easily.

This event is a sequence of events that lead to the down haul of Leng Family, and it's ultimately a political scheme - as always. This event has a few significance:

1. It marks the hullmark of how the political system within NFC works;
2. It marks the "downfall" of Leng Family;
3. It marks the rise of Xia Cheng Nan.

Of course, behind those three apparent apsects, there are lots of interest groups involved, including the parties that bacak up Xia Chengnan, and apparently, this event is a good way to show how Leng Family handles the matter and let many advocates, activists, political leaders to voice their opinions and altitudes.

There are three keys of designing this event well:

1. Good startup event, good development, good climax;
2. Realistic mapping to our world (though nonthless it's not going to be directly referentiable since it's NFC specific) and matches how people's movements work in reality;
3. We must be able to shape the various personalities, both public figures, and people behind the scene.

## Dialogues and Debates

"Some people say NFC is communism, and communism is bad. I will argue it this way: the key to a successful ideology is to make sure it doesn't become the ideology of a single leader. That's why an open source system is all that matter. And here is another point: absolutely nothing last indefinitely, so both the system and all the terms within the system must be able to dynamically adjust. The frequency of adjustment if inverse of the cost."

"I would say, we might step down now. We might never come back actually. But I am not worried, for I trust the system. I trust those who help build and maintain the system. It might be a temporary deviation from our intended path, but nonthless, since everything is still in place, we won't be making any big mistake."

(冷雪映？) "Humans are easily manipulable (show them sone benefits, and  they can forget long-term effects)" (Another way to 例证或者见证这个，是类似引用Bible，来引用一个经典故事，例如神知道夏娃会犯错，还是给了她选择的权利)
(萧衎？) "你们为什么不站出来告诉大家！。。。"
"I can see where you have confusion. We are not their leaders. We provide only guidance. The system is free to make decisions on their own."

## Dated Notes

### 20180817

* 过程：有人提出异议——发展成为投票和很大规模的轰动——冷家被排挤——Tao Ye接济冷家——重新回归对于九层楼的主要地位
* 来源：《九层楼的规则》中一条关于冷家的存在不自洽的规则其实必然暗示着人们可以并且会对冷家的存在提出异议的（尤其是这么大、不符合常规的居住面积）；另外就是冷先胜其实的确是个不方便露面的人，所以其所作所为即便有很多也不可以对外宣传和广为告知的，就很多人的异议；雪映虽然是个公众形象，但是其作为也被很多人认为多为“鸡肋”和“场面”的作为、尤其是其并不如何参与到娱乐和自我宣传方面，很多人垂涎其轻松的行为而并不如何appreciate其态度（尤其是那些作为代表真正九层楼核心价值的作为并不能够很好地展现出来），所以并不很受到人们的看好。
* 发展：外面的政府/世界也可能对内施压，在特别时期（例如珺来临？）迫使冷家做出一些作为。（可以作为是"第二次"轰动比较大的对冷家的举措的抗议行为——即在第一次之后雪映他们再搬回来、然后因为珺到来带来的骚乱和不让人满意的解释又出现了施压，不过这次就不用搬出去了）
* 相关人物：？？？（一个反面角色——但不是反动角色；可以是除了冷家和妒家（因为这两家关系还挺好）之外的另一个家族、势力相关的考虑所以这样的举动）

政治

* 夏家此人借着反对独权的口号趁机树立自己在公众的威望、拉赞助和人气，支持自己的政策、安排自己的人手、妄想自己来掌控权势。（灵感来源：接着所谓反腐倡廉的口号，其实是铲除异己的举动）
    * 然而这个策略在九层楼内其实是行不通的；首先冷家根本不如何反抗作为，再者所谓的“掌权”其实全是虚的，因为九层楼的运行模式自洽并不需要这样一种统治者的存在、并不真的可以影响什么，或者说，no one (any one who is serious and clever enough - I.e. mostly native City Nine residents) takes him seriously (only those non-domestic people like to support him e.g. external American government.  
    * 这次事件背后由外部政府支持、政策施压。
* 九层楼的”满足尽可能多的（全部）人“不是简单的”少数服从多数“，而是要求”但凡有1/10的人不赞成，则不可以通过“，所以夏家若是想要将冷家移离九层楼，就要么找到9/10的人赞同移动他们，要么找到1/10的人不赞成他们住在那儿就行。
* Politicians make promise that suits people's needs: 夏也会在口号的设计时迎合人民的需求
