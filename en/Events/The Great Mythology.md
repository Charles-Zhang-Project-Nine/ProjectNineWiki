# The Great Mythology

Tags: Tellus

Having a few (around 1-5) complete mythology systems is very useful in constructing further culture from them, and also very useful in making cultural references and naming things at modern times. The Great Mythology concerns a thread/system of mythology that is surrounded around the three initial Gods that created Tellurians on Tellus. The key focus here is specific actions, needs/desires/conflicts, meanings and symbology, and names of gods.

(Three different groups of) God initially put Tellurians on the planet of Tellus with natively evolutionay species in three distinct batches, and taught them languages for communication. Latter they always taught them agriculture and other technologies and fundations of civilizations.

The first (group of) god is Fersh, (s)he/they taught Tellurians Nacle.

The second (group of) god is Lequad, (s)he/they taught Tellurians Retaw.

The third (group of) god is Nahd, (s)he/they taught Tellurians Tatabryl.
<!-- More god names: Manis (from Savon Liquide Pour Les Mains), Les (from Les), Poura (from Pour), Skin (from Skin), Eslecanos (from Ecoresponsable). -->

The heavenly garden is a reverse-growing (upside down) field that grows in the sky, and plants from that garden drops to the ground to become beasts and events and disasters and fruits of all kinds.

Latter the gods might also punish some civilizations by completely destroy them by summoning the force of nature, for instance, the (Atlantis). Not all civilizations destroyed in ancient times are due to the anger and punishment of God.

TODO:

* Name of original three (groups of) gods (maybe we can even create their Wiki entries and detail their Fepulans player levels)

## Naming and Etymology

* "The Great Mythology": A great way to start the topic of mythology using some very general big words.
