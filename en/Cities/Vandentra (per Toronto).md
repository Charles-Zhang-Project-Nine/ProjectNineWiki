Tags: City, Tellus

Vandentra is an ancient city located in ??? (PENDING).
It's the first most active location during Tellurian-Medalian cultural exchange, and home to many of the latter-day NFC people e.g. Mr. Leng, where NFC was established on the ruins of Higasashi (Vancouver).

## Archetype

* This is the substitue for "Toronto" in Tellus world.
* We want to use Petra from Jordan to shape this city for both Vandentra and Petra shares the same word ending.

## Naming and Etymology

"Toronto" is derived from an Iroquois term meaning 'where there are trees in water' in reference to a weir for catching fish. We will use some kind of (made-up) native language with a similar meaning, in this case, "vandens" (water in Lithuanian) + "tra" (from "tree") for "water-ed trees", aka. "Vandentra".

## Architecture

(PENDING INCORPORATION "MAGICAL TELLURIAN WORLD" E.G. LOT SOF TALL TREES IMAGES INTO THIS CITY AS WELL)

Vandentra is known for its iconic rock-cut architecture and its historical significance as the (ancient) capital city of the (Nabataeans). It is also famously referred to as the "Rose City" due to the pinkish hue of its sandstone cliffs. (We will consider putting this to the 外郊 of the city instead of the main area; The city Vandentra should be rather rich and abundant with greenaries and water so it can be a big modern city)
