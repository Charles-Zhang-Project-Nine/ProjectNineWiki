It's where present-day NFC is built upon. The city and its region is renamed to NFC to signify a new beginning and help people forget the past.

## Archetype

* This is the substitue for "Vancouver" in Tellus world.

## Naming and Etymology

Since the two cities bombed in our world are Hiroshima and Nagasaki, for the moment I am just making a derivation from them: Hi + ga + sa + shi = Higasashi.
