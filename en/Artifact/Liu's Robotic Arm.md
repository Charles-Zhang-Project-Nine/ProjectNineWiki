# Liu's Robotic Arm

Tags: Story

First appeared in Canonical Core: it's a nice gesture and a gift from Zarna, who took the liberty and asked ??? to turn it into a robotic arm, with AI and nutrient absorption system. It's a welcoming gift to Tao Ye to join Zarna's earthly famly. The arm would be a friend, and it's a symbol that Zarna is also a friend.
