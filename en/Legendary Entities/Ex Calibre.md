# Ex Calibre 藏灵药

Tags: Technology, #Medalian Queens, Medalian World

“先圣之贤，贤者之精”。

由第一任天来女王Ora Busa Lika（欧拉布萨里卡）支持设计的一种特殊物体，用于[[王的洗礼]]，可以改造天来白族人、施与[[王的馈赠]]，从而继承[[王的意志]]。

Ex Alixir始终处于动态发展中，每经过一万年会经历一次升级变动，由当前女王和[[后阁]]共同主持修正。

<!-- (20230407, Proposal) 不记得这个跟Queen的剑是不是同一个东西了——或者后来剑的概念已经没有了因为被PortKey取代。不论如何，我还是喜欢剑的概念，既然如此，可以这样实现（也添加传奇和魔幻效果）——Ex Calibre在不同Queen继承的手中的形态不一样，到了KVII被打造成一把古朴的仪式用剑（不是战斗用）。使用者用这把剑刺穿或者割破身体，不会流血而是嘶嘶热气，并且获得特殊效果，拔出剑后伤口愈合。-->

## Overview

Each Queen's Ex Calibre actually only improves the Physique of the user, somewhat extending the neurological system a bit as well - and the Ex Calibre itself is a signaling device that opens the portal to enter The Inner World. 
The Ex Calibre is a delicate nano-machine that achieves lots of functions. Most of the queens are just well-trained through study and life-extended with this device and granted political power through thrones but they are not that much too different from others. It represents being granted to infinite knowledge or the self-ackknoledgement that one is now able to proceed without limit. 

Mr. Leng never discovered The Many Worlds himself - despite his desparate attempt to stay alive, he only lives longer because of Queen's blessing and that's also why he needs constant treatment in order to stay young with Cyborg technologies (partly developed by Kruks for Tellurians and other human-machine-hybrids), and he only gets a glimpse of the true power when he drinks the Ex Calibre he extracted from Zhang He using an anecdotal method; The rest of the people should generally NOT be able to use Portkey to any useful extent - maybe examine it with the power-interface (the brute force method by injecting external powers and operate through the interface Kun I left). What is given can also be taken back, later Kun VI took it back as a punishment.

# Notes

(Record) Used to be called Ex Alixir - sounds too much like video games.
