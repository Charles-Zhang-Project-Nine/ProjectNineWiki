# Phorudim

Tags: Medalian World

弗诺汀号 (Phorudim), from Fepulans -> Phorus -> Forudim, plus some holy elements. The first Medalian spaceship that initially set foot on Tellus during The Great Expedition.

## Storage

As an economical and trading strategy, the Phorudim carries large chunks of raw elemental materials, including Lithium, Beryllium, Boron, Carbon, Sodium, Magnesium, Aluminum, Silicon, Phosphorus, Sulfur, Potassium, Calcium, Scandium, Titanium, Vanadium, Chromium, Manganese, Iron, Cobalt, Nickel, Copper, Zinc, Gallium, Germanium, Arsenic, Selenium, Rubidium, Strontium, Praseodymium, Neodymium, Promethium, Samarium, Europium, Gadolinium, Terbium, Dysprosium, Holmium, Erbium, Thulium, Ytterbium, Lutetium, Hafnium, Tantalum, Tungsten, Rhenium, Osmium, Iridium, Platinum, Gold, Thallium, Lead, Bismuth, Polonium, Astatine, Francium, Radium, Actinium, Thorium, Protactinium, Uranium, Neptunium, Plutonium, Americium, Curium, Berkelium, Californium, Einsteinium. Based on availability, those elements are purified and stored as 8 meter x 8 meter cubical forms. Other compounds are also occassionally stored, including Diamonds. This particular storage chamber is highly protected and worth many many quadrillions of dollars.

(For notes specific to the layout of spaceship aka visual design, it can be put to ProjectNFC)

Advanced as we call it, the Medalian technology allows them to perform intersteller travels, creating entirely new colonies on distant galaxies and planets, harvesting energy from the sun, building giant spaceships, or hide their home inside a black hole - they are fundamentally just humans. Some might went far on autonomous and choose to become a Kruk or Kruk-like Cyborg (human-machine mix), but for the most part, despite some genetic enhancements, they carry those basic activities everyday (though the frequency and definition of "day" can vary): sleep, eat, drink, pee, cleaning, carry out duties, and do entertainments. The point here is that with advances in medicine and technology, the way and the need for certain biological needs might diminish (e.g. they don't need to eat very often) - but again, this can vary greatly by individual, by groups, depending on varying accassibility to such technologies and purposes and roles of individuals. 

What I am trying to envision here is that the spaceship living habitat is otherwise just pretty much like how humans would do it: with living areas, industry areas, food cooking and restaurant areas, entertainment districts, parsk and gardens and greenaries, research labs, etc. - it's essentially a city, compact and self-contained, all stuffed inside a floating spaceship. The cool feature of this is their energy source, and lesser dependent on stored resources since they can easily send smaller industry ships to do the mining work when they need external supplies.

The bottom line: even if space and resources might be a bit limited, and maybe depending on the configuration and purpose of the ship, a bit stringent and there might be more inequality - ideally for at least Kun VII the place was spacious and it's like a real, comfortable city with decently large populations. It's NOT that there will be a single mind and will, and every other living souls just live relentlessly without complaint to fullfill the order of that single command, in a dark and dirty inhabitat (like Startrek and Marvel depiction of alien spaceships). No - to say the least, and more realistically that otherwise, the dynamics is very rich: there are very very varying degrees of politics, lots of different opinions, and a vast array of role specializations. Individuality is a prominent nature of an advanced society, and even for something that is as organized and up-down as this Expedition trip to a destined planet predicted by the prophecy, at least 30%+ of the population will shine in their individuality (including both scientists and ordainry worker-class people), while the remaining are dull and "ordinary" (this group of people might be those highly trained, elite level soldiers, or others of the more labour intensive work that do not demand creativity, organization, and management skills) in busy will keeping up with everyday schedule and make a living by fullfilling their assigned duries.

A detail worth noting: like how in real world cities on Earth, those who are colleagues and working next to each other might not even know others' names and occupations and salaries. That's a realistic dynamic. Some groups of people are more friendly, others are more uptight, both are circumstantial.
