# Ether Series Airplane

Tags: Plane, Brand, Tellus World

Produced by General Redes; Including a suite of electrical planes.

Products:

* **Ether Model III** (II or III?) Commercial Passenger Aircraft - 以太二型民用客机。
    * Consider adjust naming to more industry like flavour like Cesna 172

通用雷德斯总共只有三种机型：

* I型小飞机
* II型大飞机
* III型特大飞机

其中I、II型都是电动机，又分民用和商用，主要是机舱内设计不一样；III型只供商用（可以临时用于其他用途也是），是Jet fuel <!--Jet fuel (Jet A-1 type aviation fuel, also called JP-1A) is used globally in the turbine engines (jet engines, turboprops) in civil aviation. This is a carefully refined, light petroleum. The fuel type is kerosene.-->，其燃料由Alberta的Universal Heavy Industry（全能重工）提供——这个公司自然是九层楼所拥有的，其环境上自然也是有诸多争议，主要是对于Alberta当地环境的缺乏保护。

Ether II cannot finish a single cross-continent trip with its battery - for that reason it needs to stop for 2 hr somewhere in Vancouver on its 直达 trip from Beijing to Toronto. It charges very fast and even with 2-hr charging, it can reach Toronto in less than 15 hours. It's very quiet on the plane - possibly because of active noise cancelling. Also the leg space and seats themselves are generally comfortable - the tickets can be a bit expensive I guess, but the trip is in general cheaper because electricity is cheaper than gasoline for Ether II, compared with other commercial airplanes, also it's much lighter at this level due to reduced complexity of design. <!--(Remark) You know what's cooler and realistic? Supersonic jets.--> 

## Notes

With the advent of graphane battery, General Redes is investing in new clean renewable energies and electrical planes.
