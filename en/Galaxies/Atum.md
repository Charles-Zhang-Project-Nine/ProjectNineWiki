Tags: Galaxy

Type C galaxy within The Simulatione.

(Currently we have only a name and no identity for it; Maybe related to an experimental test ground from initial experiments conducted by Fepulans; This is a location within Simulatione, not a location within the Fepulans world)

## Naming and Etymology

* (#Earlier) The Original A: Just signifies it "originates" something, and the name is a placeholder.
* (#20230906) Atum (pronouce "a-town"): from "Atom"? from "Avatum" (per Avatar). Consider making it THE main gathering place for The Central Stage.
