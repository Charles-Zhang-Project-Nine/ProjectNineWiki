# Recorder

Tags: Instrument

Recorder on Tellus, like Recorder on Earth, is a very traditional, long-history, easy-to-learn and use instrument for musical education and most importantly, creative musical improvasation. It might not have the most superb sounds on its own, but it's a very expressive way for musical expressions. Recorder is big in its adaption through Tellus and notably throughout the musical industry.

* (Comment, #20230825) Was reviewing our 2013 misc. Cloud Book era Ubuntu-os time notes (aka the superbly messy and crazy "_Pending Categorization Notes\Now to classify\手机keep替代（用于大型和重要文件的安置）（原大一手机用YNote，部分已经重新分类，此处是没安置的）"), and surprisingly we had quite a few audio recordings of me 哼一些旋律. Then it suddenly occrued to me we might have bought a Recorder once for music creation purpose AFTER I CAME TO TORONTO, or maybe it's when I was in China ca 2016 - don't remember, don't matter. The thing is, before we fully master Piano or Guitar, Recorder is actually a very very useful tool to learn. See text reference collection on "Recorder" for a treatise on its very practical aspects.
