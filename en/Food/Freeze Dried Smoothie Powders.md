# Freeze Dried Smoothie Powder

Tags: #Unique, Food, Dessert, Snack, Drink

(Inspiration) YouTube videos on how to use and difference between dehydration and freeze dry, which can be used on fruits, herbs, raw meat, smoothie, breads, and a bunch of other things.

As powder form, and if done properly from raw extracts (this largely depends on the 良心 of producers), it can be shelved for 20+ years and tastes great and saves lots of space compared to raw fruits. However, because of this nature, it's very easy to be tempted and not pure and mixed with other worthless and even dangerous powders, and if not labelled correctly, might be mistakenly treated as other things.
Usage: Add water and it tastes fresh - that's the amazing part. I suppose this tastes different from those cheap juice powders?

There might be a few different brands/food manufactures that specialize in this kind of packaged drinks, which are yet remain to be named/identified.
