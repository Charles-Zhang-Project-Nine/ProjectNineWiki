Flirting indicator (stick to one's back, a patch like metering device) when gaming when females - "We just want good gaming". (e.g. é­‚æ–—ç½— like two people game on a small hand-held controller device - it's friendly, it's close, it's even 'intimate', but 'we' don't want any romantic or sexual connotations)
