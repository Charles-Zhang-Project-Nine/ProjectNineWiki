# Leng Family House (冷家)

Currently we have three design contendants:

1. Japanese style as seen in anime, including at least two fashions: 1) The 院落 single household home style as in Fate Zero, or a larger Japanese mansion style as in Summer Wars. 2) Located on Level 2 of the multi-level conception of NFC.
2. Chinese style as per classical Chinese gardens, including 和珅府. 可以有围墙（作为隔断，带有那种镂空设计），也可以直接blend in the surronding forest. One way to mix with Japanese style would be to learn from style Pre-Tang dynasty, e.g. 寻秦记.
3. Dream original 龟瓦琉璃院.

Below misc. notes will be a mix of the various genres.

* (Element) The original conception of interiors involves those two elements: 1) A long, at least two 90-turns 走廊 with one side open to the 院子, where Mr. Leng can put his helmets and Samurai stuff as 摆设; 2) A japanese style interior room where Mr. Leng usually stays, one of the doors naturally opens to the exterior 走廊 - this can directly be part of the first element. The other side of the doors opens to an interior 走廊, the other side of which are another set of rooms (e.g. Kung Fu Panda 1 where 仙鹤 and Tiger have their rooms).
* (Element) 墨绿色角楼
* (Element) If it's the *Tortoise-Shelled(-Glass) Garden* then there will be a pond and an exterior 游廊, and some stone stool and a stone table (might have a Go 棋盘 on it as well).
* (Element) 门口一条石街，对面一个街坊。
  * (Element) 石街可以是弯曲下坡路，而不必平直。
* (History) They used to live on L1 in that Japanese styled hill-top house before moving to ancient chinese city like 市坊 flat terrain large tortoise shelled garden.
* (Marketing, Graphics Design) 冷家Logo（仅在电子出品资料上使用例如网站）：一个粗3px的圆圈里面一个雅黑体冷字。或者一个艺术体的细黑渐变分明的冷字。<!--(Remark) That works, but a more artistic design would be desirable.-->
* (Requirement) Must be easily transportable for arrival of 宾客, although they can also arrive in certain time slots and order. Relatedly, must also have a large 会客室 for 30 to 100-people size meetings - can be either seated or Japanese style 草席.
