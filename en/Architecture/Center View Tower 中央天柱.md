# Central View Tower (Center View Tower)

Tags: Tellus World

PENDING RECOLLECT AND CONSOLIDATE NOTES ON 中央天柱. PENDING CLARIFICATION WITH "CENTRAL COMPLEX" (and the central tri-tower residence).

* (design) Our typical way of approaching this is more like 明珠塔 (Skyscraper 2018) or Thor 2011 - too rigit. On the other hand, tree-like structure as in Sword Art Online is too fantasy and not really usefu. A really good modern direction would be Rhino/modern architecture style organic shape that may require arichemtic setup - i.e. instead of obvious traditional edges and lines, things are more curvy. That's the direction we should take.
