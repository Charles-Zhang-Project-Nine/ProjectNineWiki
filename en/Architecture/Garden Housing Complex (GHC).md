# Garden Housing Complex (GHC)

Tags: Architecture, NFC, Tellus World

Garden Housing Complex (GHC) is one of Tao Ye's original architecture schemes.

Key Principles: 

1. Single/Compound-tall building;
2. Complex/multi-functional building, garden-style, self-contained; 
3. All Charles style houses (except intentionally designed so) will NOT be saving on effort and material cost.
4. Stairs can cost A LOT (carpets or granite material); 楼梯间 can be very fancy

Consideration: 1) Less privacy; 2) Potential health hazard from high-fall.

## Template 1 - 四合天庭(中庭) Open-Community Style Semi-Enclosed Courtyard

Style defining elements:

1. The building is generally 4-sided, however 6-sided can be more aesthetically pleasing.
2. Building isusually from 8 to 45 floors high; Area ranging from 60mx60m to 110mx110m and more; Indoor side width to courtyard open space width ratio from 1:1 to 0.3:1.
3. Every floor has two sides of corridles - a private one on the outside, and a public one on the inside. Some can be reverse.
4. There is large, open staircase connection every floor.
5. Every side of the building has at least 1 elevator.
6. For higher buildings it might be necessary to have floors reserved for water reserve (for water pressure).
7. The center can be either a pond, a large swimming pool, a large open market, or a 2-12 floor tall structure (e.g. for warehouse, or a central reception building).
8. The top can be covered with glass for rain protection or completely open (generally not recommended).
9. The bottom floor of the building is usually access controlled and fully-enclosed, however this can be done with a lot of free-accessible space.
10. The outside of the bottom floor is usually garden-style, with 花圃 and pavements and seats.
11. Shops and markets and offices are generally in the lower floor, but generally available every 5 floors - unit types on each floor can also be mixed. If sound isolation can be done perfectly we can even have gyms and swimming pools in the middle floors.
12. Gardens or at even small farms might be present in the middle floors.
13. Can be full interior and atmosphere controlled by having full enclosure.
14. All floors is by design floor-tolerant up to 5cm - this design also allows washing floors by pumping water directly, especial staircases in non-fully-enclosed buildings (since it's not practical even for full enclosure buildings to have carpets on all stairs - or we just need to spend a lot money).
