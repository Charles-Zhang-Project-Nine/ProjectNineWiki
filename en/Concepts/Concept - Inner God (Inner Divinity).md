# High Concept - Inherent Intellect Divinity

Tags: Concept

(PENDING CONSIDERING HOW THIS MAY OR MAY NOT BE DEVELOPED AS A THEME - IN WHICH CASE IT WILL BE 渗透到 ALL ASPECTS OF OUR WRITING OR BE ILLUSTRATED AS SPECIFIC SCENES. WITHOUT BEING RECOGNIZED AS A THEME, THEN IT CAN BE JUST A PLOT ITEM)

This topic is at least directly/indirectly related to: (fictional) magical effect of marijunna use, (fictional) magical effect of true love/sex, religion and divinity, intellectual science and philosophy, (fictional) Tellurian gods and etymology, (theme) life after death (also see our audio recording), (element) magical world of Project Nine Universe.

## Premise

All humans (not sure whether it applies to Medalians and their ancestor) possess divinity. Divinity in this sense is understood to be a very pure/complex idea that encompasses its position in this entire universe. According to etymology/human religions this is because that's how they are made after their creators, however, scientifically speaking, this might be an emergent property of intellect itself, i.e. the capacity of intellect to perceive itself, and construct a higher consciousness, and effectively recreate itself. In our magical world background, this particular intellect is manifested in particular ways that surpass our material reality: 1) People can possess spirits and life after death; 2) People can appreciate and wield magic, 3) Through transcendental practice, people can effective become gods.

People in this world are divided into three types: The Rich, Gods/The Ordinary, and The Mundane. (To propose a way to look at all other Gods as equal and of the similar kind - knowingly living in this seeming ordinary but in fact magical world)
To become The Rich is a priviledge - it's a matter of heritage, and everyone else starts from The Mundane.

## On Becoming Gods

To become one of Gods, there are three ways:

1. Sex with True Love (not everyone will)
2. Taking the Magic Medicine (highly dangerous, needs necessary dosage, may die when overdose, may get addicted when keep using under-dose)
3. Holy Revealation (I have no idea what that means, does that mean being visited or lifted by a Fepulans directly?) (Actually I think it meant more along the line of 元吾式 or our own imagined intellectual revealation - you just see yourself as god, and see yourself as one of those players that plays this game. Effectively reliving what's known as "Story of Two Brothers")
    * The transcendetal experience may or may not be manefested multiple times.
    * (Gods are NOT humans with a bit extra power - Gods ARE just humans; The Godly powers are achieved through mechanisms and gods themselves are as vulnerable as humans; Notice that humans with proper technology and scale can do as much damage as individual gods - like nuclear weapons or Krukian technologies are nothing shorter than the scale and power of godly strength. A notable feature is that when cultivaters are killed, their body may explode if not controlled, because they are effectively containers of immense cultivation energy, just like a condensed bomb - but generally, their skins are pretty "thick" or at least heavily protected. Notice that Krukian and heavy machines tend to burn and explode as well when destroyed violently because of the ways energy are stored and leaked and reacting) <!--I think this means "human" gods. Real Gods are fepulans players.-->
4. The idea of true love along with the legends of cultivation can be a "lost legend" applicable directly to local Tellus hemisphere. Ever since earlier industry and cultural evolutions, the precence of such deeply cultured individuals decline and the difficult paths of self-cultivation is passed by only within limited population simply due to its sheer difficulty and to the most people they will never have chance to encounter those. There ARE however known cultivation masters but within human's capacities (unlikes Medalians) before genetic-engineering era (e.g. around the same time as Drone stories) there is very limited in what they could achieve. Other very very rare and accidental masters have already left the Tellurian world. During and after the Drone era, however, humans discovered a genetic lock on their spiritual capacities and it's after that the rise of magic become a thing again after thousands of years of fallout, during an era with high-tech.

(Role of God: God cannot change the world, they cannot see beyond past and future, and they have no fear - but this sounds pretty useless. Possibility one: They are granted their own, independent, unshakeable world. Hence a peace of kind, where they can go after their body dies. Possibility two: There are only one/two people in this universe, and the experience is nothing but role-playing, and in this sense God indeed knows it all, but he can't and won't do anything because all other roles are simultaneously being played by him. So All Gods are actually a single identity. The Rich is not affected by God. God is the owner of the universe. What the revelation actually reveals is it lets you see the rules set out before, clearly, unshakingly.)

There is no supreme divinity but there is magical bonding power of oaths in the west land, beaking which will caude imminent punishment including death. However, this DOES not apply to east landers: oaths means nothing for people across the sea. (Inspiration) Song -  默
