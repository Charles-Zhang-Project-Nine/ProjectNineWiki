# Central Stage of Universe/Central Stae of the Universe (CSU) 宇宙中央区域

Tags: Mythology, World, Construct, Simulatione

(PENDING RECOLLECTING ITEMS FROM HERE TO DESCRIBE THE STRUCTURE OF CSU: https://phys.org/news/2023-09-billion-light-year-wide-galaxies.html#google_vignette; Also let's do Reference MD )

A region within The Simulatione. It's considered the most densely populated region within The Simulatione and the only region where Fepulans Players can travel freely into. The cental stage of universe is teeming is Fepulans Players, legendary miracles, human/fepulans-like NPCs/people, and original Simulatione life forms and artificial simulatione life forms. 

CSU has over tens of thousands major galaxies. In any direction there should be 10+ galaxies. The rest are observable but outside CSU.

## Naming and Etymology

* (#Earlier) Central Stage of the Universe: Placeholder name.
* (#20230911) Ho'oleilana: Per structural reference, repurposed name use. Might need to tweak it a bit to differentiate from real-world entity and avoid confusion, e.g. call it Ho'oleilado.

## Civilizations

Among various other civilizations and life forms, those are of particular interest within CSU:

* Fepulans players on "The Kingdom" (El Starkan 艾斯达坦) (A realm or a collection of scattered planets)
* Homo Sapiens (Humans) on Tellus
* Neputalis on Eva (Protected Region) (Comment, #20230831) I was thinking about moving this place out of CSU, but well it makes sense to keep them there, but at least they should be protected.
* (We need 7 to 9 more civilizations that those Gods frequents)

Note that Medalians on Ids is NOT within the reach of the Central Stage.
