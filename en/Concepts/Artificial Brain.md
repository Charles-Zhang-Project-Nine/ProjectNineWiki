## Original Technological Iterations and Appearance of the Brain

**The Primitive Era**

Before things get down to the quantumn implementation level and becomes miniscure and highly optimized, the brain was largely a "mechanical/electrical" device that tries to mimic instead of reproduce the exact functions of a real Medalian brain.

## Notes

* Artificial Brain: artificial general intelligence, machine intelligence, global neuronal workspace, Integrated information theory, intrinsic causal power, "the greater the system's integrated information, the more conscious the system is", consciousness meter, "two networks that perform the same input-output operation but have differently configured circuits can possess different amount of causal power - one can be zero the other can have high level of causal power Î¦", a brain's "connectome" - the complete specification of the exact synaptic wiring of the entire nervous system, human brains have roughly 100 billion neurons and quadrillion synapses (only if it can be specified on a quantum machine!), A person's brain can be scanned at ultrastructural level and upload its consciousness - as fully specified by its cinnectome - to the cloud so people can live on the digital after life and through electrical means integrate with the real world (philosophically whether it actually feels anything or is it a "deepfake" per GNW and IIS cannot be settled yet and that is part the reason why Miah bans such technology because such consciousness's relation to the underlying physical configuration cannot be settled in terms of its intrinsic causal power to affect the world - but the Dark people have managed to realize that by assigning eletromotives and cause real actions), neuromorphic hardware, cortex, epicenter, machine as objects for means to and end vs subjects as an end unto themselves with senses and feelings (concerns domination and who controls who and superior intelligence power)
