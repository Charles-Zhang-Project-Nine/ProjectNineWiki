Recognized by all countries around the Appes Lake, The Holy City is a dedicated theo-shrine for (Tellurian) God (PENDING) and has supreme status over the sovereignty over many neighboring countries and more distant regions - in fact, the entire West continent recognizes God (PENDING) and thus The Holy City - even (China), which is governed by an atheist party. With less than 1000 permanent population and less than 120 acre of area, it's the smallest country in the world by population and by area.
