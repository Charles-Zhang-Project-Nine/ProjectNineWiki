# Koban

## Dated Notes

* (20230723) 讲真这一路下来，也没啥特别有趣的见闻😂 感觉纽约挺适合购物，那地方是真的大（虽然脏乱差）。剧院也挺多，可是这种演出一场都要好几百RMB，也不是什么可以天天看的东西。相比之下还是想去日本，哈哈😂 A country, due to bottleneck of technology and culture - they had long history, used to be VERY violent and now democratic and peaceful, and they had EVERYTHING THEY COULD EVER HAVE, people have no desire to spend money any more. 民族气质：世间繁华不过如此。

## Naming and Etymology

Koban: Just thought Roman and Japan has "an" as ending so we need "an" as ending. Was originally thinking of Korado, but with "an" ending, Koban sounds good. Turns out it's the name of a historical artifical in Japan. We can rename it latter.

## Archetype

Japan after financial boom per legends from Gainan - they are in recession now and people don't want to spend.
