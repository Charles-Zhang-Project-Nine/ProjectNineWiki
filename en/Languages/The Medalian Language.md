Medalian Language (Design) Tests: Here are the various tests conducted by the Language Design Committee when coming up with the new Medalian Language (the current language): Shouting test (must be audible, must be easy to make louder sounds), Speed reading test, Prettiness test (must sound good). Here are further tests for the scripts: Recognizable in a distance, font/typeface tolerant, distinct and meaningful (thus graphic), limited strokes (quick writing).
