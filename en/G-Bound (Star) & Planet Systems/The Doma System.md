(Pending testing stability of the orbits of the two moons of Ids; Pending testing stability of the entire Doma system: test on Universe Sandbox.)

The Doma system in the galaxy of Pescus is the home of Ids, where Medalian people lives. It has a single sun named Doma. 

The Doma system consists of 6 orbiting planets orbiting its star: (in the order of distance close to far) Puma, Wilamuda, Ids, Fukxim, Naku, and Zai.

It also has an inner astroid belt (named "???)" and a further distance boundary of its solar system. <!--(Remark) Maybe we should explore a bit on making the Medalian solar system a stable double-star system, since those are said to be abundant out there in the universe - we need to study some examples of this kind and habitats of their orbiting planets. -->
Within the inabitable zone, there is Ids, the home planet of Medalian people. More distant to that, we have (in this order): Fukxim, Naku and Zai. Ids has two moons: Yei and Na-o. Fukxim has two moons: Osmuk and Niou.

Many many additional moons...:

* Tinne <!--(Remark) This name is unclaimed; I think it would be OK but maybe too obvious (which was not how I came up with this word, which doesn't really matter) if it denotes a planet/moon that's small. -->.

## Naming and Etymology

* This system is named after the name of the sun; For the name of the sun, see Wiki entry on Doma. Ancient Medalian people talk about Doma with a sense of religous awe, recognizing they are not the center of the universe yet nonthless this home system is all they've got and where they rightously belong. This is especially significant because during the Civilization Crisis the alien species insists them calling themselves (the system and the sun) Inceverus (from "insignificance") or Hustal (from "hutsala"), and lots were died.
