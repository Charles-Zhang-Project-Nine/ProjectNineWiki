(PENIDNG MIGRATING IN NOTES FROM EARLIER DOCX;
PENDING CONSOLIDATING WITH P9 KMD/GENERAL INDEXED NOTES)

A unique commodity system deployed at NFC as experimental opt-in rating of individuals, and is also a must-in for new-borns and PRs. This system is intimately interconnected with a few other systems at NFC, including ID system, Phone Ring system, Credit/Banking system, P9 open platform, job system, P9 skill/knowledge certification system, and P9 Permanent Residence policies.

## Notes

* (#20230806) Originally we perceived this system as an idealization, but nowadays coming to think of it - it actually provides a good bencmark/measure on what counts as good and valuable activities. For instance, even nowadays, we still have the issue of sometimes having a difficult time finding peace to play games - on the other hand, I can very easily find a comfortable spot near lake and just sit there for 10-20 minutes.
