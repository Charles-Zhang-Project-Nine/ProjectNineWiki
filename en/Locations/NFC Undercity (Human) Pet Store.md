# NFC Undercity (Human) Pet Store

> "Second hand pets, they don't bind easily with others any more". (Idea from) Why I don't like those two cats at Jerry's. Maybe they are not like cats I used to have.

(This is P9 Original/九层楼原生 because it's from an earlier unorganized time where ideas are more spontanenous and random)
(We had a dedicated note on the original design of this concept, but so far as of 20230921 we haven't been able to find the original notes)

Funded by ??? (some Tellurian/Krukian) and operated by (some Tellurian and Krukian), this underground illegal store satisfies the need and fantasy of suppresed Medalians living underground of NFC. This is however a rather small-scale store, with just slightly over 3 rooms and a dozen goods under display/for sale - the same industry is much more robust in Doma system, where (while still being "underground" but not literally) large supermarket-size stores are open for shopping for Tellurian/Human/Krukian and all kinds of other alien species as pets, and with much more enforcements, food, and supply goods for sale (we will create a wiki entry for it when the idea gets more developed, the site is likely NOT on Ids but on some secondary planets in Doma or maybe some colonies on moons).

## Naming and Etymology

* We always called it 地下城宠物店 or 宠物商店, apparently a more interesting name with more interesting back story is needed.

## Goods

The goods available for sale in this location is a representation of the greater variety at sale in more developed pet stores (e.g. in Doma system):

* compound compressed solid high protein healthy food (like western dog/cat food). They are healthy, they are nutritious, it's just not so organic.
