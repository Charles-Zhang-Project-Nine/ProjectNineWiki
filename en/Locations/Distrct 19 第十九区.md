## Archerecture

* Krukian architectures and constructs can be assumed to be mostly functional - in fact they may not need large obvious compounds for the most times, so the main driver for visual styles in this location is going to be Medalians.
* If there are any substantial Medalians, then the architecture styles will be dominantly shown in a fashion according to the original cultural preferences of those who came here, largely: Konralikan, ???, and Modern.
* If there are any humans living here at all, humans will "mess up" the style by adding-in human community features (e.g. advertisement signs) - and the most interesting kind of inhabitants in this regard are (Chinese)/(Japanese).
