# Undercity 地下城

Tags: 九层楼原生, Tellus World

(PENDING DECIDING ON ACTUAL SCALE OF THE CITY, PENDING DECIDING ON THE POPULATION DISTRIBUTION OF THE CITY, PENDING DECIDING ON THE LEGAL STATUS OF THE CITY, PENDING DECIDING ON THE OPERATION AND DAILY COMMERCE OF THE CITY, PENDING DECIDING ON THE AWARENESS OF THE CITY FROM OUTSIDER'S VIEW)

因为鏖战之后泰勒斯大部分地区对于天来一切不友好的状态和自己的天来出生，冷先胜建造给天来遗族。地下城原本打算塑造成九层楼一个都市传说人尽皆知却真实情况人人都不知道的秘密。

## Core Feature Structures

* Sideway reactor: Either standalone reactors or power transmission from the nuclear reactor from NFC directly.
* Underground water way: large-capacity underground tunnel waterway that allows cargo ships or alike to passthrough, can be simple cylindrical structures.
* High-rised "hole" market place: see concept illustration 20231226 HIgh-rised hole market place. (Remark) This would suit our vision of a dark underground open-space marketplace.
* Places for battles, places for residences, places for local faction controller administration
* Entrances and connections to the outside world and to the city above

## References

Entity references:

* We could reference things from 缥缈之旅 underground structures to 鬼吹灯 like palaces, but more realistically [Palestinian tunnel warfare in the Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_tunnel_warfare_in_the_Gaza_Strip) is a live example: "The tunnel has several branches and junctions, along with plumbing, electricity and communication lines." Mostly it's (like 南京方山) 防空洞 like structure. Greater underground cities include Zion in The Matrix, or [Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Area_Outer_Underground_Discharge_Channel). At the moment we are yet to determine the exact (overall) structure of the city.

Design Requirements: Here we provide some high level executive design requirements for this underground structure to function as intended

* It might have multi-layer structure, and have sub-structures that can accomodate multi-faction control scheme.
* It must be deep underground and should not affect construction integrity of land above - e.g. for high rise buildings.
* It must somehow have connections to either deeper-underground resources or external resources, including food, water and industrial resources.
* It must must somehow allow larger-capacity transportation vehicles to come in and out in order to allow greater goods transporation capabilities.
* It may feature teleportation portals.
