# Open Sauna

Tags: Location, Kanit, Tellus, Building, Tellus World

## Layout

Waiting room Style（Kanit）旁边就是Sauna很小，前后两缸，后面的缸可以看到上面一整层红色墙装、假山观赏。

<!-- (Remark, #20220524) Unfortunately we didn't not find time to do an illustration of this scene - two scenes actually, both the entrance to the sauna room and the sauna itself and the floor above). I don't know how much I can remember when I finally get back to this in the future. -->

## Notes

<!--Per 20220523 lucid dream:
Sauna, Sleep in sleep. (Lucid Dream) Incredible details: bite, chew. Difficulty transition into waking
清明梦：sauna water涨水促醒
-->

* Notice places like this though represent the general cultural uniqueness of a country/region, the scope can not be confiend to the entire "Kanit" - because even within the country there are many proinces and within provinces there are many cities, each with unique tourist and local cultural and behavioral uniqueness; This particular location's arrangement should be just a single isolated case that's not generalized to the entire Kanit culture; Though it does mean that Kanit culture can have favor on public baths (e.g. countrary to some modern colonized countries like Austinbu).
