# Pantagruel 庞塔格鲁埃利安 "(In) The Palace"

Tags: CSU

Pantagruel is a location INSIDE blackhole (or it is the blackhole), and it's inside The Palace, which is an entire galaxy. The edge of Pantagruel contains information of the entire universe. Surrounding Pantagruel and outside the blackhole are thousands of immediate non-solar-system orbiting planets. As per sketch 20230909, this is not even the main playground region - this is merely the "beginner" area. The majority of Fepulans players are distributed around nearby galaxies surrounding this center place.

## Naming and Etymology

* From "In Interstellar (2014), two of the 3 terrestrial planets orbiting supermassive black hole Garguantua are proper blanets. The other one orbits a Main-sequence star named Pantagruel" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanet): we google "Garguantua" and found book "Gargantua and Pantagruel". We take Pantagruel, look up its translation, and found "庞塔格鲁埃利安". Actually I just noticed it mentioned "The other one orbits a Main-sequence star named Pantagruel". So to avoid obvious collision, we probably want to rename it.
