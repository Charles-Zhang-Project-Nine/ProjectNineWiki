# Nations of the World

We use "Nations" over "Countries" in this wiki because nations is a larger concept - it can include regions/communities/identities that may not necessarily be identified as (politically/internationally recognized) "country".

* Nations: a community of people formed on the basis of a common language, territory, ethnicity etc.
* Country:  an independent sovereign state or part of a larger state, a physical territory with a government, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people; Including countries and sovereign states (city states).
