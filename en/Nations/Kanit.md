## Archetype

China-like, Close friend to Russia.

Notice there is no such a thing as "modern day China", which both has a deep history, deep world influence and remain as a single large country - on Tellus this is not the case. Kanit may have a lot of cultural influence before the WWI, but after WWI it's divided into two parts.

## History

Later divided into Takensian (TNE) and Nerssua - *this happens AFTER NFC's formation*.
