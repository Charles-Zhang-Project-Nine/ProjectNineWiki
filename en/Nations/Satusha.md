## Archetype

**2022 Feb Russia**: Has lots of old 领土问题 with neighbouring regions due to "historical reasons" - whatever it might be. It's a source of conflicts and potential wars. When Satusha wants to invade a neighbouring country, *the free world* will not support it while the "old socialism" countries will - and that can further get escalated into a global war.
