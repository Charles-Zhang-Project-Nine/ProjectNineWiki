## Archetype

Partly influenced by 西藏 - but let's make it a completely unique identity. It's a normal-sized country with ordinary setup, with about only 30-80% of population having religous belief. The religious system is quite flexible here, with influence coming from many different religions and traditions. One thing unique is that Buddhism took a special turn here since its original 传播 - the development of 甘传密宗 - 甘藏, which allows completely new methods of development and training of Buddhism practices. 

The 虹化飞升之修行 method is 现代东方修行的基础 for some modern-religious countries that have close friendship with Gandi due to their religious bonds (not including Kanit).
