Tags: Nation, Country, Tellus, Religion, Buddhism, Tellus World

Country on Tellus; It's to the south-west of Kanit.

Names: 诺沙/诺莎

Not a religious country - and not even a country/nation at all. It's a region and a cultural identity of people that lives in broad land area with very unique 盆地气候 and lots of dry lands. The 原型 is 西藏<!--Unlike on earth, this region does NOT have territory issues with Kanit (since Kanit already has issues with its two divisions which represents 中国大陆 and 台湾/香港-->. This region does NOT have its own army - and even though it doesn't have a government per se, for thousands of years this place live in harmony and in isolation with the rest of the world (because this place is very tall and high in altitude), and its people are very religious/spiritual because they all belive in one single religion (like 西藏教), which is a particular branch of Buddhism from since like 4000 years ago.

## Archetype

Originally conceived to be 西藏-like, but now we have Gandi to share part of that identity, I think Nerssua can be more "Arabic" - desert environment, squareish blocky sand-colored buildings, very hot climate and very religious.
