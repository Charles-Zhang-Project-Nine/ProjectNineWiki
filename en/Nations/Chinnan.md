## Archetype 原型和期待

We need a country that is "what modern day China would be if it's 民主自由, like Taiwan" - but certainly more than Taiwan because Taiwan in the modern day is too weak. However, we cannot just use the archetype as China since any culturally deep and culturally bounded country is NOT likely to be very immigrant friendly.

We also wish that NFC can have lots of oriental architectures, so ideally NFC is established either in this country directly, or NFC is established in a place where lots of people are from this country (which will also work if lots of people from )

So the final archetype would be **Japan** (with a free and liberal society, close with "western" culture - aka. like Taiwan) (while geography-wise speaking it's like Thailand, Vietnan, Singapore): with its native culture but also very nice blend of oriental and western, with the tweak of making it more immigrant friendly. HOWEVER, with any culturally deep country, there will be lots of moral boundaries and restrictions, and people there can seem more 严谨 (morally, not scientifically) in some "traditional" way.

## Geography

* Capital: Chensh/Kensh 清释

## Politics

If  is a classical and old-power country, then it won't be very "friendly" to immigration - the people are pride, the population is saturated, and there is simply no need for this country to attract many long-term resident foreigners.

Also, if  is NOT a developing country but a developed country (since we want it to be like Taiwan as a cultural influencer) - it's NOT likely that many  population will migrate to Austinbu, or NFC (since NFC is founded on Austinbu) <!--Unless Chinese immigrants in our world - China is NOT a good place to live in, that's why people would want to move out; You don't hear American people immigrate into other developing countries that much: only developing countries immigrate into developed countries. This is not a hard problem: we just don't let NFC have that many Chinese/Japanese style architectures but be more modern; This also has another design implication: it's still fun for Zhang He to go to Chinna for its culture, but wouldn't it be more fun is Zhang He went to a developing country, so it's more "dark-side" of the society that he can see?-->.

Chinna: Religious/Dogmatic politics - Mandate of Heaven (神权天授). So it's not just "communism", in fact we should steer away to make it not so apparent it's just simply a criticism of communism, and dig deep the rationale behind things. E.g. Leaders do believe they are doing a good thing.

## Geopolitical

多岛；土著本土文化比较分散，大量从？？？ (China)引入文字和文化和建筑。

NFC is established here.

## Notes

This is plot specific, and we should consider either making it into history/facts and put under corresponding wiki entities, or consider putting to Legends of NFC though practically we only talk about humans there, not countries and 传言 there.

<!--(Correction, Reminder, @Confusion, @Canonical Minicore) It's not Chinnan (since it's 自由世界代表) that's hiding a teleportation device - it's a small country (依附Sabutan的) that's doing those dirty business.-->
