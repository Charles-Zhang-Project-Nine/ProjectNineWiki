## Legacy of Art & Architecture

Some of the distinct features from this era including arts, arhictecture and some other cultural things. (idea from) The ancient [Greek/Roman public bath](zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/古罗马浴场) are said to be called "balneum" or "balnea" - well, it's certainly not just this particular region that have public bath, but its style is distinct and representative of a particular high fasion. Such a country doesn't exist on Tellus, but the sound of "balneum" sounds interesting - we can make it a ancient kingdom near Mediterran (of Tellus.) "公共浴场不仅是大众洗浴的地方，也是主要的社交场所之一。同时在豪华的私人住宅中也会建有浴室。浴场的用水通常来自附近的河流，或者专门挖凿的水道。浴场用水流到热水浴室之前会在专门的空间中被柴火加热。" It's part of high-culture, albeit a classical one (since modern world is different from this, aka. privacy-wise speaking). <!--Notice there are practical reasons for public bath to be popular in the past and not so much in modern days: in the past it's the only choice for people, and at modern days there is bathroom in every residential building; We can however change this in NFC.-->

Example usage: "巴尔农建筑"，“巴尔农式浴场”
