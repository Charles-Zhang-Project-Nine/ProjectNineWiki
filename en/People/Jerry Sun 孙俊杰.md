(PENDING COMPLETE RENAMING: WE MIGHT DISREGARD ALL THOSE NAMES AND RECONSIDER AND RENAME ACCORDING TO KANIT CONVENTIONS AND LAST NAME RULES - 萧衎，萧何娜，张老爷，胡祖豪，赵倩雅，孙俊杰，赵世强，孔先生 and everyone related to Xiao Kan in general)

Born in Austinbu, family is Kanit immigrant.

上一代来自(A China-Like Country (Not Chinna)) Kanit，小时候在Kanit受教育，高中回到Austinbu。因为Kanit的气质影响，有一种Austinbu人不拥有的放浪不羁。
Has a cousin (just want to use the name): 孙婉莹

Jerry Sun is a playboy (in a good way) - his family is SUPER (in a hidden way) RICH! See entry on Jerry Sun's father.

He made that sexual acquaintance with Catherine without knowing it's the famous daughter and future owner of the city - it's a total mistake, at that time she was practicing/designing a new program and Jerry mistakenly arrived 2 days earlier than the official opening date of 醉生楼。<!--(Remark, #20211228) This does sound more natural for this particular character than for Xiao Kan. Although in that case we might not be able to tell this story in the more “official” Saudade collection - since that story is rarely about Kerry Sun, nor much about Catherine Leng. -->

## Archetype

(Character, Design) 孙俊杰就使用孙俊杰自己的家庭背景加艺术修改，单亲、跟父亲关系很好，很敬佩和向往父亲的洒脱。

孙俊杰人称孙三郎，（跳下飞机之前）“哦对了/萧兄，下次见到我时/日后有缘再见，请叫我孙三郎！”狡黠的一笑。(灵感来源) Shanwen说Jerry摆放女友没有update三次以后体力不支睡了）孙俊杰在西天极乐世界认识了王善文，也是个会玩的人。以后相关项目再提。
