# 祝西城

Tags: Non-NFC, People, Tellus

(Back story) <!--Move this to legends of NFC-->Ex Calibre is a signaling device that opens the portal to enter The Inner World - the way 祝西城 can enter that world was that during his examination of Zhang He for his issues - Zhu got some of his blood for studies, which he then extracted the peculiar substance by accident. One accident leads to another, evetually he will find out about the Portkey kept inside Ten’s Giant Gates.
祝西城 is observed as someone who has peculiar behavior but very "low key" (but not really because he's making big money with his medicines) - he's someone who benefits himself by exploits the system. Somehow we need to find a way for the protagonist to discover this guy, then find its peculiar behavior, then figured something is fishy with him, and trace it back. One potential starting point is the legend of his medicine skills - somehow the protagnoist might get curious enough or have the need to consult him personally due to medical concerns.
