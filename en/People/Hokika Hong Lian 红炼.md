Sister: 白斩

## Etymology

(Early Conception) 红衣：琨、筱、红练
Naming: 红炼/红练 -> Hokika
Medalian name: Hokika Lin2/Link 霍奇卡琳

## Personality

Very straightforward person when she trusts you - she will speak her mind without any usual Tellurian female's 遮遮掩掩。

## Appearance

早起洗漱装束。红练对外时颇有种很冷酷的气质。

* 最爱她的眼妆😆
* 背着一个形状古怪、红缎包裹的大木盒子？<!--(Inspiration, Idea from) 有些腿特别细、紧身运动裤（但是比较得体那种、不是突出臀部的）、背着弓箭/瑜伽毯去健身/打篮球，看起来很酷。就像是背着一把吉他。-->

## Delicacy

红炼和白斩自然是截然不同的个性和人物，但是一个共同点是每天必须化妆不论出门还是不出门。

## Love for Xiao Kan

If Xiao Kan's romantic relationship with his girlfriend back in Kanit was some innocent puppy love (no matter what mature adult courtship there was), Xiao Kans' affection for Catherine is merely a rebound crush, and Xiao Kan's selfless love for Eleven is 困境中际遇相同的人的怜悯 and empathy - Xiao Kan's fun friendship with Hong Lian is the true love between the two, the happiest, bondage free and authentic mutual affection (and they did a lot of wild stuff, sexually speaking).

The highlight of their relationship is in that traditional (Chinese-like) holiday celebration night when he's temporarily lost her and looking for her - the short scene of 众里寻她 and the two met each other in the eyes and the worry transforms into happy laugh. Such is the hightened connection between 萧衎 and 红练 before he's unfortunately sent to outer space. When Xiao Kan was missing, Hong Lian was desperate and for one time in a deep depression - the first time since Kun VII was gone. She tried real hard when Kun VI arrived trying to get to the bottom of it and trying to get him back. There was a lot of trouble, she got to do some deeds for Kun VI before Kun VI would grant her very limited resource so she can go on the journey alone. She becomes even tougher in this trip - God knows whether they will meet again in such a long journey.

## Early Life

Hokika had a dear sister comrade during her years of military training back in the home world named Aulsa Tuannin. They were so close and can be considered lovers.
