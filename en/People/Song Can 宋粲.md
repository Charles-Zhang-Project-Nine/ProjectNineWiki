Names: Song Can, 曲蚕山
Original Name: Song Can 宋粲
Nickname: 蚕歌, 蚕山曲轻 (Online)
Pen Name: 曲蚕山
Birth Date: 2003-08-14[[ I am thinkng 2003 because if Saudade was written by him in 2050+, then he should be fairly old, ideally even close to death, after having being working as a writer/historian for more than 35+ years.]]
Age: (Younger than Tao Ye)
Occupation: Writer, Novelist, Historian

## Background

宋粲是冷先胜手下一个写历史、编故事的 <!--Maybe Song Can can focus more on 正史 and fictional stories - I mean, when we say he works for Mr. Leng for history and story-making, I didn’t mean he is making fake history. On the other hand, I think Mr. Leng would want someone who is knowledgable to help him dig real history so Mr. Leng can gain more insight into some legends. The story-making function of Song Can might be to create CofN-native mythologies etc. for entertaining the public. To summarize, in general, there shouldn’t be any need for Mr. Leng to fake whatever history for political purpose - however it might make sense for Mr. Leng to “hide” certain confidential information that he doesn’t want the public to know (e.g. if the existence of the Undercity is a secret - which I am not so certain these days).-->。

作为一个多伦多本地人、Western大学史学出身的人自有其严谨性，但因为职业需要、fictional literature与自身的渊源，所以也可以算是个想象力天马行空的人了。在楼内以**蚕歌**为名的也有过几部小说颇为知名，寻常教授级别的人物，也参与过一些正史和九层楼史料参考文献的编纂，闲暇时候喜欢写一些针砭时事、历史小品在自己的博客上与人分享。宋粲是在九层楼的前身由Tao Ye和冷先胜创立的投资集团大力发展商饮(商业？)、购置地产的时候与冷先胜/Tao Ye在**威斯波尔***建筑与人类史峰会*上认识的(yes, a very business setting)，那会儿新重建不久的**威斯波尔文史学院**也在招募人才，便遇到了。


Some of his famous novels: The Prehistoric Civilization/Super Ancient Civilization "史前文明" (text treatise, proses; Origin of agriculture etc) <!--Notice Baidu Baike topic on this is not "prehistoric" at all (per anthropology sense) but pure picture, which is fun to look at: baike.baidu.com/item/史前文明/1246168, also see offline `(百度百科, Garbage) 史前文明（历史时期）_百度百科 (8_13_2021 11_43_59 AM).html`; Song Can's work can also cover things more ridiculous like here: zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/超古代文明, ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/超古代文明-->, *The Total War* (historical novel) , *Dark Planet* (sci-fi), 

# Notes

<!--(Design, Remark) Legendarize, personalize this character so it makes more sense. -->

<!--(Remark) This background is to help promote and provide enough historical rigorousity from a literature point of view, and enough technological background from a technological history point of view, and enough social and literature experience from a personal point of view - such a person as the writer of the novel should be good balance between depth and humor. -->

* (idea, 蚕山曲轻, 冷家, Leng Family, Character, People, Mr. Leng, Tao Ye, Catherine Leng, novel) 小说作者**蚕山曲轻/曲蚕山**本名宋粲，九层楼ID Can.Song@nfc.city，外号因此**蚕歌**。

<!--(Pending) One thing pending figuring out is when Can Song was born, when the (he?) started to have the idea of writing out as a novel, and when he finished the novel. *Ideally he should be younger than Charles and Mr. Leng so he has more time on such fictional things*. 

Per story plot, *the writing must happen after Charles's timeline on this universe ends* (aka. Kun coming back) - we could even try to capture and reflect this by changing the tone of writing between first and second half of the book. Making the first half more joyful and second half more glamorous. Also even though Can Song might be close to those people, a lot of details can still be unknown and thus **his speculation must have a limit in terms of assertions** - he can write as if things happens in front of him, *but ultimately he just heard of those things and is just recreating what he gathered and imagined to be truth* (if this is true, we must think about how this would affect the available amount of information he can possible tell the audience). Ideally, there are some things that happened and described/illustrated as truth that even the author - I.e. Can Song himself aren't aware of what's behind the facts. For instance, **he may not know the true origin of Sky Dome** and maybe he can only points out several things that might be providing clues but couldn't really pin point how they all fit together.

We can make this scheme/structure much more vividly by making sure the novel itself (i.e. Saudade) begins by telling the readers that this is a recollection of the many years of research into the city, and finally putting together a picture of what happened in the past. The book itself was written in 2050+ (as per Forward 署名).

It also makes sense **for him to mention himself a few times in the novel**. -->
