# Overview

# Description

## Brief of Life Path

* The wedding process took long at NFC and it costs a lot of money, effort and training to get it through, and that final celebration she through together with Xia all constitute not just the personal affair but a whole dedication of career and part of her life in those years. (That wedding of Du and Xia is the last test of their three year long marriage process) (Actually we should even give this a new name, to differentiate from Marriage. Consult latin pronunciation)

# Notes

The beauty of her is so stunning it's not just in her apperance but in every sense of her existence; It's difference from the glorance of Kun, yet also different from the elegancy of a traditional "well-behaved" person; Definitely not delicate.
