# Ela Bu (Tao Ye)

Ela Bu is Tao Ye post-time travel, due to special time period and his status, and more importantly, going back to an environment of the past which demands him to behave well while at the same time be around Zarna again - those all contributes to his great personality/behavior style change compared to when he was at NFC (both as a cityzen, as a teacher, and as a cult leader).

His job has one major critical risk: the trust issue is impossible to be justified and his mission to persuade Kun VII is a very daunting task. However, Kun VI or Mr. Leng or Kun VII herself may have given him some 信物.

## Naming and Etymology

* Clues: Derived directly from her name -> Derived from something of her past/liking -> Named as exactly just a hero she admires and told him when he was very young, which also happens to constantly remind her of that hero
* Alternatively, it's just Medalian word for "Hero" (as first name), and last/middle name would be either made up or after some people (if there is such Konralika tradition to inherit last names).
* For now, we are taking "Ela" to mean "hero", and "Bu" just as something that sounds good after.
