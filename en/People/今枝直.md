# 今枝直

Tags: People, Tellus, NFC

* 成就/主题: Significant contribution to building CofN as a better (from physical point of view) accommodating city to the disabled. Trying to experience the life of the disabled by living among them by experiencing their difficulties. This can represent his work and CP contribution.
    * (Idea from) This character is our chance to think, explore and make our city a better place for everyone - for instance how on earth do the disabled use computers efficiently using only sound and touch based interfaces? Remember when we were going we wished our school have this one day "disabled" day so we know what it's like to have such inconvenience by playing with it.
* 特征: 戴黑色缎带的主动失明 (might do it only during public events; He should still at least release it at home to avoid actually losing sight)；臂长为单位的房间布局，家里安全角的装设布置；小童照顾起居、学习；通过听读、小童去寻找资料（没有使用**Airi**; Why not?）来仍然进行学习；不依赖视觉的思考；局限的空间活动和Ｋｉｎｅｔｉｃｓ；因行为局限而简单的生活状态；对外人而言以为他就是失明了。
* 人际关系: 今枝直与**冷先胜**交往甚多，但未必十分宽泛，只是频繁，因为他们是棋友——[[盲棋]]。
* 人物成就: (前期主要是商业和经济模式方面的；对社会也算有不小的理论上和形式上的贡献)
* 发展和设计方式: 没事自己尝试着闭着眼睛行动、体会其中的 <!--(Remark) This sentence was incomplte in the original note, not caused during migration.-->
* (Remark) Is this character even significant? Otherwise we might want to ditch it. (Remark, #20211230) Well, if he's friend of Mr. Leng, then we might have a chance to at least mention his name (e.g. Catherine to her father: "你今天有跟今枝先生下棋呀？“)even if he doesn't appear much later.

生日:

姓名灵感: 取自白夜行里面的*今枝直巳*。我对于今枝直这三个字觉得很有好感，打算自己用作昵称，后来想到可以作为一个人物。

> Now you are gone, there is no beauty left in the world, I will close my eyes forever for you. - An inspiration from a headache night in shower

* Pending Deprecation, Move to Backstage; This name will certainly not be useful any more now we are in the context of Tellus, but we can still use this character.
