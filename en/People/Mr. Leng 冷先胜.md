He has the duty as deputy of the Queen to take care of everyone untill Queen returns. Kruks do not listen to him and due to the hostile altitude of Tellurians towards Medalians, it's not easy to manage. For that reason Mr. Leng build Undercity as a fortress under NFC.

## Naming and Etymology

老爷子（冷先生）：冷晏笑/冷先胜/玦

## Background

Originally born on Kai in a (what kind of family)....

## Entrance to the Inner World

Mr. Leng’s mystical studies are for the purpose of seeking a way to live forever - while he’s kept young using Kruks’ technologies, he’s quickly aging under the hood, even with Kun VII’s blessing early on (when Kun VII’s gone, he receives no such blessing).

The Sky Dome was only created when Mr. Leng’s inside the Innerworld (in a manifestation called The Many Worlds) - but he only entered it once with the help of an enormous amount of power injection (probably with the help of Kruks as well), and never managed to enter again.

Mr. Leng never re-discovered The Many Worlds himself - despite his desperate attempt to stay alive, he only lives longer because of Queen's blessing and that's also why he needs constant treatment in order to stay young with Cyborg technologies (partly developed by Kruks for Tellurians and other human-machine-hybrids), and he only gets a glimpse of the true power before he got Ex Calibre.

Through his effort in discovering methods of living eternally (probably more convinced so after he hearing about Xirams from Kruks), he obtained the information from ancient Medalian books that heirs of the Queen runs blood of the Queen, and potentially contains traces of Ex Calibre. Since then (which was quite early) he started making this “essence extracting device” (probably with the help of Kruks) to extract such alixir from Zhang He.
Using this anecdotal method he successfully gets and drinks the Ex Calibre he extracted from Zhang He and obtained the ever-more-powerful ability to interface and extract energy directly from The Many Worlds (he never knew The Many Worlds was just part of the Portkey and it was just part of the power Portkey can offer) - which he himself considers as the legendary “meta-world” as described in 道教玄学 books found on Tellus.

This new-found power gave Mr. Leng quite some devastating matter-transforming capabilities - it’ a **different kind from the sort of quantum-energy elemental magic that we have in this world**: it’s a power of raw, brute force, capable of destruction, BUT it’s not sufficient for creation, for this reason Mr. Leng still needs constant medical treatments, though he himself might be capable enough to destroy some bad cells and symptoms this way, he can’t make himself fundamentally better. He’s **anxious and angry** by this fact.

What is given can also be taken back, later Kun VI took it back as a punishment for abusing such power.

## Service to Kun VII

## The Road to 神化 in NFC

The training led Mr. Leng to be able to traverse through time and history through mentality across the local universe (aka. Earth or the Solar system) to some quite far-stretched time lines. Mr. Leng met The Contractor (the dealer, the broker, an ancient indian who speaks Arabic) while he's travelling in 太乙迥境, with who he strike a deal to bring back Qianqiuye Jundai, the requirements were: 1) A dead person into a period where it didn't exist; 2) In exchange, a physical experience memory recollected since the contractor doesn't have a body. The delivery was made to the Portkey, which The Contractor is aware of and has access to. <!--(Remark) Most likely 祝西城 had a similar deal when replacing saving his life and replacing 张老爷's dick. --> <!--(Remark, Writing) The key in the writing or depiction of this is NOT to just mention the skill, but to talk about **specific information/details**, e.g. if Leng was able to travel to the past, then what additional interpretations/details that he can observe based on a more intimate relationship with the situation? Like how 寻秦记 adds additional (unnecessary but fun) interpretations to historical events - **a reinterpretation of history**. In other cases, if Mr. Leng has access to all sorts of things happening around him, then when he is actively making an observation, he should be invincible. Unless, of course, the trap in 太乙迥境 means he was there only once, into a specific time period, and never again could he freely enter that level. -->

## Goal on Tellus

Portkey requires tremendous amount of power to operate, and even so only momentarily. The original shrine was a power house; Later first queen completely mastered the secrets of the Portkey and magnified this fact by adding the energy barrier to accessing it - pretending this device needs charging. 
Kun VII brought the device with her when she left Kai. Mr. Leng always wanted to help build **Dyson Sphere** for the Tellus because he desperately wants more - he used to be able to use that nuclear fusion power to momentarily power the device.

## Seeking Longevity

Maybe a bigger issue for him is: without her (Kun), he's getting older quick. Despite his power, a mortal cannot deny fate. Maybe not in terms of appearance, since Miah people can be trained in that, but physiological capabilities, he's degrading. How evident? Should we somehow depict this chance of motor skills? Of just misc health issue? E.g. Used to drink cold water now must be very careful. （倒像是我自己的慢性病）

## (Deprecated) Habbit/Routine

* (Leng Xiansheng, Bai Zhan) Leng Xiansheng needs to do a medical examination every months or three months. That's one of the few chances he will leave the house. Bai Zhan will be accompanying him, but in fact she's doing the examination as well. The fact is, it's not simple medical examination, and it took way longer than something like a teeth examination - it's brain examination. During this time they need to make sure the materials are not deteriorating and everything is functioning correctly. See discussion on **Wireless Brain Control Technology**.

## Routine

* 跟千秋叶一年见一次<!--The relationship is very very likely sexual-->，其余时候用书信联系。(idea from) For a good, solid, trusting relationship, once per a long time (相见如故) is beautiful.

## Habitat

冷先胜的书房很大，200平方英尺（这个单位是不是不太符合文化？）、很空旷，只有一张桌子。榻榻米下面摆放了书籍等用品。<!--(Inspiration, Idea from) 在家呆着其实很伤、而且不利于工作，没有效率可言，去公司、学校等更有利于专注。一个原因可能是，大学比公司还要大上太多了吧。-->

## Illicit Offspring && Adopting Catherine

Lots of (potential) trouble that Mr. Leng had against the entire Medala system/law is he had a child with Kun VII - that's strictly forbidden by the regulations of Queens.

<!--张鹤和雪映可以是同一天出生，这样比较方便。-->

Mr. Leng used to try to teach Catherine, when he (momentarily) felt affectionate and "want to do some good" (as all parents sometimes do). Once he tried to reach her the way of perceiving a different world (in this universe, see below for Alternative Worlds), requiring her to calm down and try to meditate and feel the vibration of the universe, and even to practice this everyday. May or may not be at that time Catherine was going through her puberty, so respectful as she was to her father, and even though she has been practicing some of his arts for a long time (only secretly? Because he's not willing to teach?) - she can’t resist a bit resentment to him.

## Managing Zhang He

Mr. Leng’s attention to Catherine is like a camouflage - when Mr. Leng and Zhang He were alone he tried to teach me (him?). But of course Zhang He was irritable towards Mr. Leng: "what is the evidence that the things you mentioned even exist?!" "Evidence? It's right here! Light is the evidence - when objects move at relativistic velocities they shrink to become flat. Light are such objects that are moving so fast they literally become pure energies that light up our world!". 

Before Zhang He leaves CofN when he had a fight with Catherine. Mr. Leng get the news and asked him back for a talk because he deemed it necessary before he leaves. However that wasn't easy given that their relationship at that time was already not good. Then it happens as described above. During that time, Zhang He asked: "then show me""I can't""then how do you know it's true""because I have seen it, if you just allow yourself to calm down and follow my instructions I might be able to show you as well""it's just your hallucination, how do you know that world even exists, how do you know it's not just your own made up syories""it is a manifest of our minds, and indeed we could have done it in many ways, but some are different than others, some are more ????(superior) and guides us towards the gate of another world, but you got to follow what is true rather than get confused by your own bias. When you shall do that, you will be able to achieve much more, and even affect this reality.""yet you don't have a proof""I cannot show you""enough bullshit, I am leaving""I know you have it in you, no matter what you do, remember my words, ....""I don't know why you summoned me here and not Catherine. Is she involved in all these?""you are not an ordinary man, you mustnt let what you seen confuse you..."

## The Mythological Geograph

> No it's not just stories. All those things recorded were once happended before, it's just they are now lost in a different world than ours. (Instea of claimg they are evidence for real things in out present world.) One needs to investigate and find the path towards those ancient worlds.

The world was conceived as being divided into eight directional divisions, at each of which a mountain pillar supported the sky. Bu-zhou was the northwest one (Hawkes, 1985 (2011): 94-95, 135-136, 323).

In mythological geography, Buzhou Mountain a was located near Jade Mountain (Yang et al 2005:161-162, 206).

This world, as is called the **classic world**, exists in **pre-Qin China** (i.e. somewhere after **Warring States period**).


**Places**

According to the legends, several **sacred places** have can contain **hidden treasures**. During his **journey to the west** (towards the **ancient source of China** and **all mystycal powers**, which co-existed within our **perceived world** in a **parallel universe** - notice we avoid using clearly existing physical terms like 'dimension' to avoid misuse of terms, so we don't say those world exist in a "different dimension" because that doesn't make sense). According to the legend, there are **two kinds of worlds**, the first is the universe of **perceived worlds**, the second is the universe of **the real world(s)**. The former contains a large amount of **alternative universes**, while latter cannot be directly perceived by **humans** (**Kun** might be the only known entity in the world that can access that world and even directly draw power from it). However all algernative universes are nonthless only a **manefestation**, or according to classic philosophers (like **Spinoza**), an **"effect"** of the single, underlying universal real world.

    * 政治：目前除東部傾斜坡仍為中國所管轄外，大部分屬於塔吉克斯坦，只有瓦罕帕米爾屬於阿富汗。
    * 中塔关系：**西漢時期**，**中原**開始與**內亞**通商，商人沿**絲綢之路**往來中亞各國，必須穿越**帕米爾高原**。这里被認為是歷史上西域和中亞的分界嶺，有天山、崑崙山、喀喇崑崙山、興都庫什山等交會，漢代又叫蔥嶺。1890年間，由於俄國亟欲指染清代新疆、英國對西藏有野心，因此兩國簽定英俄協定，大致以興都庫什山為界，由英國取得瓦罕帕米爾，俄國取得北部。中華民國成立以後，在帕米爾高原始終無法有效統治。但中華民國政府始終將帕米爾高原西邊的噴赤河視為是中國的極西點。在1960年代中華人民共和國與阿富汗簽訂邊界條約，正式承認放棄瓦罕帕米爾。2011年1月13日塔吉克斯坦议会表決通過中塔两国政府签署的勘界协定，決定歸還給中國1158平方公里，即2002年《關於中塔國界的補充協定》中的中華人民共和國獲得的第十五界點至第二十三界點一線新定國界與原實際控制線之間的領土。但反對黨領袖卡比里（Mukhiddin Kabiri）批評說，塔吉克斯坦無條件將土地送給中華人民共和國，正代表塔吉克斯坦外交的一大挫敗。但塔吉克斯坦外交部部長札里非（Khamrokon Zarifi）卻認為，這是塔吉克斯坦的一大勝利，因為中國原本聲稱擁有的領土範圍，多達2萬8千平方公里而中华人民共和国外交部发言人洪磊在例行記者會上表示兩國領土爭議已全面解決。他說：「根據兩國平等協商結果，依照國際法條文，全面解決兩國領土爭議。」洪磊表示，在與塔吉克斯坦解決領土爭議後，未來中、塔雙方將可進行更大規模的合作與交流。

Kunlun Mountains

The ancient mountain as described in the classics only exist in the classic world, and it not obtainable/accessible from modern world - to enter it, one must find the connective paths between classics and prescence.

《山海经·海内西经》：“海内昆仑之虚，在西北、帝下之都。昆仑之虚，方八百里，高万仞。上有木禾，长五寻，大五围。面有九井，以玉为槛。面有九门，门有开明善守之，百神之所在。”《淮南子》：“昆仑之丘，或上倍之，是谓凉风之山，登之而不死；或上倍之，是谓悬圃，登之乃灵，能使风雨；或上倍之，乃维上天，登之乃神，是谓太帝之居。”干寶《搜神記》卷十三：「崑崙之墟，……其外絕以弱水之深，又環以炎火之山。山上有鳥獸草木，皆生育滋長於炎火之中，故有火浣布。」王嘉《拾遺記》卷十：「崑崙山有昆陵之地，其高出日月之上。山有九層，每層相去萬里。有雲氣，從下望之，如城闕之象。」

《史记．大宛传》：“汉使穷河源，河源出于寘，其山多玉石，采来，天子案古图书，名河所出山曰崑崙云”。蔡元定《发微论》：“凡山皆祖昆仑，分枝分脉，愈繁愈细，此万殊而一本也。”陶公《提脉赋》亦云：“大致察脉起自昆仑”。崔鸿在《十六国春秋》中，称昆仑山为“海上之诸山之祖”、“天下名山僧占多”。《古今图书集成》载：“西王母所居宫阙，在龟山春山西那之都，昆仑之圃，阆风之苑。有城千里，玉楼十二，琼华之阙，光碧之堂，九层元室，紫翠丹房；左带瑶池，右环翠水。其山之下，弱水九重，洪涛万丈，非飙车羽轮，不可到也。”

Going back to more ancient times, the four pillars were broken; the nine provinces were in tatters. Heaven did not completely cover \[the earth\]; Earth did not hold up \[Heaven\] all the way around \[its circumference\]. Fires blazed out of control and could not be extinguished; water flooded in great expanses and would not recede. Ferocious animals ate blameless people; predatory birds snatched the elderly and the weak. Thereupon, Nüwa smelted together five-colored stones in order to patch up the azure sky, cut off the legs of the great turtle to set them up as the four pillars, killed the black dragon to provide relief for Ji Province, and piled up reeds and cinders to stop the surging waters. The azure sky was patched; the four pillars were set up; the surging waters were drained; the province of Ji was tranquil; crafty vermin died off; blameless people \[preserved their\] lives. - Huainanzi

Long ago, when the world first began, there were two people, Nü Kua and her older brother. They lived on Mount K'un-lun. And there were not yet any ordinary people in the world. They talked about becoming husband and wife, but they felt ashamed. So the brother at once went with his sister up Mount K'un-lun and made this prayer: "Oh Heaven, if Thou wouldst send us two forth as man and wife, then make all the misty vapor gather. If not, then make all the misty vapor disperse." At this, the misty vapor immediately gathered. When the sister became intimate with her brother, they plaited some grass to make a fan to screen their faces. Even today, when a man takes a wife, they hold a fan, which is a symbol of what happened long ago. - Duyi Zhi (獨異志; c. 846 – 874 AD), Volume 3, Li Rong

"The snakes shall unlock, the mural in the temple with obsecure, the dynasty will turn toward you." (Wait, is this original? Sounds pretty cool) - Prophesy of ???? (a persuader of Leng's behavior seperate Nuwa and Fuxi, taking her over) (Leng found out that, according to [Siku Quanshu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siku_Quanshu), [Sima Zhen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sima_Zhen) (679–732)'s commentary on the prologue chapter to [Sima Qian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sima_Qian)'s [Shiji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_of_the_Grand_Historian), "Supplemental to the Historic Record: History of the [Three August Ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sovereigns_and_Five_Emperors)," wherein it is found that the Three August Ones are Nüwa, Fuxi, and [Shennong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shennong); Fuxi and Nüwa have the same last name, Feng (Chinese: 風; Hmong: Faj). As such it's very unfaithful/evil/better word to entangle/marry with one herself, which becomes Leng's argument to seperate Nuwa from Fuxi, and in the end killing him for "a better good" because he represents all the darkness inside her, which "guides and fullfills you at times and distracts you from your holy purpose at others", however after Fuxi is dead Nuwa shall never find her complete soul as predicted by the prophesy. Leng also bribed the gods which Nuwa was once prayed to to let her be the goddess of marital affairs using the treasures he has found in other worlds, and pursuaded them to threaten her to divorce Fuxi - source: "In the collection Four Great Books of Song (c. 960 – 1279 AD), compiled by Li Fang and others, Volume 78 of the book Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era contains a chapter "Customs by Yingshao of the Han Dynasty" in which it is stated that there were no men when the sky and the earth were separated. Thus Nüwa used yellow clay to make people. But the clay was not strong enough so she put ropes into the clay to make the bodies erect. It is also said that she prayed to gods to let her be the goddess of marital affairs. Variations of this story exist." Also notice since according to **Fengshen Yanyi** Nuwa is the daughter of the [Jade Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Emperor) so Leng will need to be careful messing with his daughter - maybe he can manage to find some weakness of Jade Emperor as well.) The story can also be inpsired by this (comments of usage in brackets): "Nüwa is featured within the famed **Ming dynasty** novel **Fengshen Bang**. As featured within this novel, Nüwa is very highly respected since the time of the **Xia Dynasty** for being the daughter of the **Jade Emperor**; Nüwa is also regularly called the **"Snake Goddess"** (or the some call it the **"Snake of Beauty"**). After the **Shang Dynasty** had been created, *Nüwa created the five-colored stones to protect the dynasty with occasional seasonal rains and other enhancing qualities* (not used, alter to fit the original). Thus in time, **Shang Rong** asked **King Zhou of Shang** to pay her a visit as a sign of deep respect. After Zhou was completely overcome with **lust** at the *very sight of the beautiful ancient goddess* Nüwa (who had been sitting behind a **light curtain** - very likely in the room of heaven), he would write a small **poem** on a neighboring wall and *take his leave*. When Nüwa later returned to her temple after visiting the **Yellow Emperor**, Nüwa would see the **foulness** of Zhou's words. In her anger, she swore that the **Shang Dynasty** would end in payment for his foulness (so for Leng to control and overcome Nuwa, he must appear to be a man with great ambition and even greater power in order to properly attract her, which he is). In her rage, Nüwa would personally ascend to **the palace** in an attempt to kill the king, but was suddenly struck back by two *large beams of red light*. After Nüwa realized that King Zhou was already **destined** to rule the kingdom for twenty-six more years, Nüwa would summon her *three subordinates*—the **Thousand-Year Vixen** (later becoming [Daji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daji)), the [Jade Pipa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipa_Jing), and the [Nine-Headed Pheasant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiutou_Zhiji_Jing) (That's quite some great sexual pleasure; So what we can do is during the time when Leng was approaching Nuwa, she sent out those characters again to try their best to attract Leng, however being aware of such ancient stories - because Leng has travelled to a timeline earlier than Shang Dynasty and even possibly a different world from Fengshen Yanyi, but he is aware of the power and strategies she have, so he's well prepared - he wasn't moved at all, which greatly impressed Nuwa, and maybe at that time Nuwa wasn't married to Fuxi at all, and at the time Nuwa and Fuxi was engaged and fallen in lover Leng managed to cause a tradegy death of Fuxi and be there when Nuwa needed a man most). With these words, Nüwa would bring destined chaos to the Shang Dynasty, "The luck [Cheng Tang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_of_Shang) won six hundred years ago is dimming. I speak to you of a new **mandate of heaven** which sets the destiny for all. You three are to enter King Zhou's palace, where you are to **bewitch** him. Whatever you do, do not harm anyone else. If you do my bidding, and do it well, you will be permitted to **reincarnate as human beings** (notice how ancient gods do dirty biddings with evil spirits to materialize their purpose)." Thus, with these words, Nüwa would never be heard of again, but would still be a major indirect factor towards the Shang Dynasty's fall." 

Also according to the saying "Nüwa created mankind due to loneliness which in time grew larger and larger", she must be a very lonely woman in that world, so if Leng can be there properly, he should be able to attract her deeply. Maybe as a twist to the plot, Leng first met her while **there was no mankind** (during his first travel which didn't last long), and it was great pleasure they could meet - only after that and out of the miss of her lover, she created man mimicing what her lover looked like - that's why Miah people looked like earthlings. Then later when Leng came again Nüwa and Fuxi were survivors of a great flood and already in love (By the command of the **God of the heaven**, they were married and Nüwa had a child which was a ball of meat. This ball of meat was cut into small pieces and the pieces were scattered across the world which then became humans.). Notice there is a higher order of gods above those deities in the heaven.

冷先胜当年足迹所过地理：(Before everything he studied at Mount Penglai, met the [Eight Immortals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Immortals) - also see [Horae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horae)) 因为没有中国签证、也没有任何身份（或许找个更好的理由），所以冷先胜没有从大陆去到这边，而是从塔吉克斯坦下飞机，作为行程的起始点。Then follow the trace of [the great floods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Flood_(China)). He has visited almost all the **sacred mountains of china**, including .... The first thing he found was **the throne of Heaven**, which after he presented to Nüwa to obtain **the right of throne** and get her trust and favor he used to forge **the humane key to the heaven** and take the jewls from that throne and use them on his **sword of the heaven**. He found the ancient god in ??? [Nüwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nüwa) (notice her proper name is 媧 wa or gua, and that's how he calls her), helped her murduring [Fuxi]() because he's plotting against .... (some other sage-rulers?) (or better still if they were still in love but just Leng managed to break their relationship, causing them against each other, each ally with some sage-rulers for **the sacred war** - notice Nuwa both the sister and the wife of Fuxi; One way he could do this was to summon the ancient moral of shameness and forcifully seperate them), which violates **the Way (道)** and its **potency (德)**. So she can become the proper God of ancient world, truly uniting Heaven and Earth, dominating the fate of all gods and mankind for the next 5000 years and claiming herself the true reverential name Wahuang. Then he had sex with her, and get her bless into **heavenly ??**. He's always good with powerful women, and he did it again and obtained her full trust and support. ... Afraid of she found out and blaming her for stealing **the Sky Dome**. In the end while he was leaving, he took away the **five-colored stones** patching the **azure sky**, causing the disruption between Heaven and Earth again, releasing [Ao the great turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ao_(turtle)) loose for revenge, causing deadly fires and floods over the ancient grounds, and fleed back toward human (the presence) world. He is thus cursed by all ancient gods and forbidden to enter the Classic world ever again. However with the five colored stones which contains the ancient power of the five **Chinese elements** (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water), along with all other things he has stolen from the classic world, he can further forge and refine his own weapons and build the foundation for City of Nine. (They used to live in [Nuwa's Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nüwa_Palace)) \[Dedicate a chapter for this story so it's a little more polished and more approachable and delicate\]

冷先胜这个人就是又色又贪、有野心，还妄想长生不老，但是都控制的十分精深，说算计太小心眼，说城府不够描述其精深万分之一。白斩（侍寝）和千秋叶（每次汇报时都是缠绵时——注意到这儿有一个重要的一点是千秋叶不可能单纯是一种submission和基于感恩而给予，因为她是一个能干的女人而不可能是局限了自由。她即便不是多情、但也至少对男女之事淡薄、尤其是当涉及到俩人的性事时、她肯定也是受益和享用的一方、或许会比较主动也不一定。这儿所折射的是她和查尔斯的关系：作为冷先胜的女人查尔斯自然不敢动她、但查尔斯年少多情、就必然是看她的反应进展。而她受冷先胜指使去侵入查尔斯身边，与查尔斯近乎朝夕相处而知己知彼、时间久了与冷先胜那边淡了的情义就足以被对查尔斯的欣赏和崇拜或者单纯是烂漫所期待——但是一个女人经历如此多、又不是环境时代的重又重大变迁、她有可能从新去欣赏一个痴情男人的烂漫？）都是他的女人——若不是听闻她的美貌，即便是再“顺便”其实也没有必要非得绕去日本一趟救她出来。当初去到上古世界的时候他曾经是伏羲参与炎黄战争时的一名得力战将（杀而代其）、后来也封为当地的Deity，逐渐才取代伏羲赢得女娲。在日本时他也是扮演为人臣、在千秋叶要自刎时救了她——所以千秋叶有时跟查尔斯讲话说错口会提到“冷将军他。。。”也只有如此才能够真正征服人心（这是他惯用的技俩、之所以作为珺臣说不定也是如此）他好色但不迷恋色、所以可以在女娲和圣物之间毅然选择后者，他贪婪而不执念、所以懂得舍得、对财宝求而不恋。他妄想长生，但却不求迷信道路，而是苦修，他要控制全部的人、但也是身处背后通过门客间接影响。正是他这种能够屈服、又行动自如的性质才可以带来他的实力。

# Notes

<!--所谓天外有天，人外有人，人在江湖，很多争斗冲突往往身不由己，纵然冷先胜法力胜天、在地球上可以呼风唤雨，除去管理九层楼所需要面对的政治压力之外，或许还有从个人角度而言所需要经历解决的磨难——如果从武侠/传奇的角度来写作的话——换言之，如果冷先胜并非是退休隐居了的前辈高人，那么必然仍然actively engage in all kinds of 事端和争夺：包括资源和法宝。这世界上不会只有冷先胜一人可以到达瑞土、拥有传奇能力，古今中外修真得道的高人、宗教领袖、各派精英，其中明争暗斗、勾心斗角、大动干戈自然少不了。只是在当今社会，这些争斗未必是大规模的人尽皆知的公开争斗，倒可能是在比试场、私人宅院里面发生。想象Fate: Zero/Fate: Stay Night/Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows那一类——寻常人可以波及到的是偶尔的新闻播报为爆炸、火灾、失踪事故。¶如果穹庐本是将population控制甚至炼化之邪器，那么各派高人，正或邪说，想要争夺，可以与冷先胜在5层平整公园约战。-->

## Key Features

1. As a (intelligent and knowledgeable) father who raises her since young, he knows every thing she know and what she's thinking about. That's partly his altitude to her. Like kids dont learn the concept of sharing etc. Idea from:. A kid cannot come up with "I eat fear for breakfast" by herself, nor can the father teach her that because that's weird.

## Impressions

* (Kun to Mr. Leng) “你最大的问题，就是不能好好做人、偏想着长生不死”（改口吻）冷先胜不爱听
