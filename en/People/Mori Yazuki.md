## Naming and Etymology

1. Just thinking of random Japanese-like name, and Mori Yazuki came to mind.

## Archetype and Inspiration

Archetype: Myself when I am younger, and myself in a world where there are bullies and one can defend oneself without getting into trouble - a world much like Emily & James world and there are not that much large gangs (though there are a few), but there are small independent groups and people are brave and had to occasionally fight a bit to avoid trouble - because there are languid/idle/jobless/游手好闲 guys wandering around street (because overall it's farming society with lots of population and abundant food).
