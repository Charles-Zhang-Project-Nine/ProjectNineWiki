> Out world is created by an external (likely omnipotent but doesn't necessarily) being. (And he's not referring to the Fepulans, nor the Tellurian Gods aka. the Fepulans players - he's referring to something even higher level, outside their world, i.e. CZ)

(PENDING COMPLETELY REWRITE THIS WIKI ENTRY IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER INSTEAD OF AS MISC COLLECTION OF RANDOM IDEAS)

(I RECOMMEND GENERALLY ORGANIZE THE SECTIONS BY TIME PERIODS, AND IF NECESSARY PROVIDE OTHER HIGHER LEVEL TREATMENT SECTIONS ON CERTAIN THINGS. INSIDE TIME PERIODS, WE CAN TALK ABOUT ALL THINGS RELATED TO EDUCATION, ACHIEVEMENT, PERSONAL TALES, AND EVEN NAME CHANGES).

1. (Design)  命运：极度偏见、甚至傲慢的悲剧人物，以增强故事的戏剧性，否则过于平淡读来味同嚼辣。又因为这个人物身份上容易使人联想到作者，就不能在某些地方用的太完全。就故事上而言，想要塑造的涉及[[梦生|世界特异性]]镜界的（相关情怀），我们则可以通过其他人物、故事、线索来表现。这儿主要的工具包括（男主角）萧衎，（故事核心人物）冷雪映等其他一些载体。因为这样所以关乎那个[[13/14岁小女孩]]可以理解一个成年人的意向我们就不放在查尔斯张身上。
    * 最终归宿是？？？（天来主星）上那个梦生般的地带。
    * 但是注意到因为是塑造自己，所以给人的积极引向引导很重要（而且九层楼里面所有人物都是为了inspiring因而都具有motivating power、因为positive/activating motivation），注意到查尔斯张的这个命运是性格方面（的一部分），其个人成就、高度empathy、设世理想等也是需要equal渲染的。
2. (Design, reference) 自我写实：所写即为真实，或者使之成为真实.
    * 五官还算端正、个头矮小的男人，戴着黑框眼镜，乍看之下。。。
        * Height as a theme in modern society, rewrite it. Treat it as norm as only 萧衎cares because he's a contrast.
    * 学识、经验等的塑造、自我积累
3. (History, education, Whisper, CofN) 查尔斯初高中（一般中学阶段）是Kun7入侵（换词，入侵包含了抗拒，但Kun7 Hunting该是更为severe和silent的）时珺胤的Subject，也自然因此跟她一起在Whisper学习军事历史、人类文化、建筑学、工程学、以及人类计算机专业。后来天来退出之后、九层楼还没有建设前，查尔斯很有可能去了悉尼学习建筑，在悉尼建筑学院认识了夏洛特孙。
    * (Establishment, Mr. Leng, 萧衎, identity, early) 查尔斯在故事中出现时大概48岁，那会儿雪映20出头，珺7入侵是35年前也就是查尔斯13岁左右，珺7统治延续了7年之久等她消失已经是查尔斯20岁的时候，这会儿冷先胜还没有立即回到查尔斯（这时候冷先胜忙着Astral projection）、冷雪映也没有出生。大概三年之后也就是查尔斯25岁时冷先胜找到他开始建设九层楼，总共耗时20年。查尔斯25岁时冷雪映已经出生最多1年，他的年纪刚好是一个可以温柔细腻对待一个小侄女的年纪，当雪映7岁左右，查尔斯31，恰到好处。所以自萧衎入城，九层楼已经establish从查尔斯30到48共18年。注意到虽然从25岁开始设计和着手建设，那会儿天罩还没有到手，在从事quant trading、买断多伦多房产等（天罩等也是原先并未可知的结果）——那会儿都还是稍微economical、engineering一些但是也算是寻常的创业经历；当冷先胜获得天罩、放出来之后的18年间、大量发展和利用天来科技和R19文明力量、自己保护起来自由发展，这会儿九层楼科技才开始远远超越外界。
4. (Design, idea)  印象: 
    1. 设计师；九层楼首席世界设计师、XXX（组织名称）的XXX（职位名称）、XXX（公众职位、功能名称），九层楼早期创始人之人、带领设计了XXX和XXX（卓越成就）等著名建筑。（参考人物：Elon Musk一样既专业又活跃在媒体；但是演讲能力要比Elon Musk强了许多吧）【Pending more personal information and character experience and achievements…；出席参加许多公众活动、概念设计发布会等；是偏向政府组织的前台人物（雪映等往往后台作为）】
5. (Design, character) ''爱好：''（每天）建筑设计
    * 注意到Tao Ye很多地方很雪映一样（因为雪映是Tao Ye的意境造物、也因为雪映从小很崇拜爱慕Tao Ye所以很多习惯都跟他很像）：会烧菜做饭、生活很多mild精致的小情趣、除了去教书每天都会穿不一样的打扮
6. (Design, Background, Catherine Leng, 千秋叶君代) 查尔斯的成长该是比较坎坷的，其成为建筑师也好、获得任何别的成就也好，并不是一蹴而就、先天安排的道路，其中也多有对于生命和选择的uncertainty。例如有一次他就对雪映/千秋叶君代提到过： “我那时几近绝望，我担心自己再怎么努力，都写不出一首好歌”“直到后来你（再次）（意外的）出现在我的生活中——我一下有了灵感（所以雪映他们住的那栋楼、是Tao Ye灵感所发出来的”/“所以我不分昼夜的拼命？？（做某件事情），直到后来发现，那样的艺术根本不适合我——一首好歌的（定义）。。。“
* (Design, character, occupation) 身份：[[威斯波尔]][[卢卡森建筑学院]]建筑史系**传统古建学**教授、也教授创造性建筑理论，但是不教土木工程和现代建筑的课（这些鲁卡森一脉的人更加擅长），在东亚传统古建和民居、欧洲中世纪教堂建筑方面尤其有深厚造诣，自家的[[？？？？（Tao Ye家名称）]]就是他设计的；后来与[[冷雪映]]一起主持设计建造了[[醉生楼]]。

* "九层楼的设计师"，Tao Ye负责了九层楼视觉艺术和城市布置各个层面的主要设计
* 冷家是他设计的
* 喜好：（食物）红豆口味冰肉
* 相关：[[Home Design|Tao Ye家（待命名）]]
* Occupation: Guest instructor in Architecture at Whisper, Operator of [[珺胤??|Pending organization name, pending english name]], Supreme designer at City Concoil (''Pending organization name''), with supreme conductor [[XXX]] and supreme planner [[XXX]]; Also taking Engineering courses at Whisper
* 梦想是例如（这座城市里的每个人、不论贫穷贵贱，都有个地方可以watch world walk by/或者三个目标：每个人都有电脑用、清洁能源、世上没有艾滋病，以及measurable actions）——每个人都有属于自己的地方可以居住、生活、世上没有偏见？
    * (City management) Everyone has a job, everyone is well utilized, realize full value and enriched personal life
    * Every man and woman in this world have a place where they can live comfortably (and feel safe).
* 称呼：Tao Ye（自我介绍），Charles（亲友），Charlie（朋友），Char（朋友，查尔斯张，Master（Airi），？？？（冷雪映），？？？
* 生日：三月五号 (Need to conform to Tellurian calendar)
* 有一个居住在中国的朋友，经常书信往来（九层楼跟外界交流的方式、除了去边界输信或者个别“网吧”去连接到外面（或者根本不提供），主要是书信，速度还算快。

## Naming and Etymology

~~Charles Zhang~~-> Tao Ye，字蚕山曲轻 silk Mountain，号梦游散人。

(CONSIDER NAMING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ORIGINAL BIRTH PLACE AND PARENTS' BACKGROUND)

(Original Name) Ideas:

* ~~Channu/Channyu (from Channu) 禅奴~~
* Charles -> Cerol <!--"Charles" is not a legit name since it's not earth and Charles was never a real person, historically speaking; Make up something new with similar etymology-->

Name: Charles Huang/Zhang (查尔斯·张/查尔斯·黄) -> Tao Ye <!--For something as short as "Tao Ye", it would then make absolute no sense for him to have an English name-->
Original Chinese Name (Notice he's born in Austinbu as an immigration family): ...
Original Name/Former Name(s): Huang Zhengjian (黄争剑) or Zhang Chaojian (张朝剑) or Zhaojian (赵荐/赵简/赵艰/赵剑)
Nicknames: People call him "The Dream Architect", because his designs are stolen/borrowed from his dreams, or actually, done in his dreams.

We need names in three places:

1. Original Tellurian name (migration background from some western country to modern day Chinna from parents' generation or 2 generations up)
2. Personal changed name after growing up and fully adopting local culture; Change of personal identity. (Depends on local culture of naming, e.g. family tradition or after famous people)
3. Medalian adopted name (might be given by either Mr. Leng, Kun VI or even Zarna).

If we are going to name after a famous person (like "Charles"), here is a potential path: 

1. From latin-like localization "royal man": Regili ("Royal man" regii viri in Latin)
2. From Chinese-like localization "张达“: Ten, Da (per "张力、tension) -> Tenjia
3. Modification of original name, remove lastname and become known only by first name (3 YY), e.g. James Gatz to Gatsby.

## Basic Information

Parents: (Father) Tao Xianzhi 陶先知, (Mother) 曹又如
Birth Place: PENDING

## Habits

* No sex: Since age 20 Tao ceased sexual activities and gets more devoted to his own religious leadership activities. Though as it goes, The Last Order seems to encourage sexual activities between its members.

## Description

### Birth

Tao Ye was born in Toronto in *year 1983* <!--Time flexible, can be worked backwards when needed--> into a local middle-class family in the **Etobicoke** region (his father was **Thomas Young** and his mother was **Yuxia Zhang (张玉霞)**, both were computer scientists), studied in order at local kingdergarden and primary school **Oliver School** from 1986-1992 <!--Time Fixed based on entry time of Medala-->, then attended local public high school **"Victoria High"** for 2 years before moving into private junion/senior high school in 1995 - (fictionalized) The Imperial College of York (ICY), where he meets many loyal friends, including **Cai YuHong**, **Xu Rui**, **Liang Hui**, and **Leo**, who will accompany him for a long time afterwards. During his time at Victoria High, he made aquantaince with the only other Chinese-decendant girl who would have an important influence on his later life, **Dugu Yuting (Amily Liu)**. In year 1990 Medala (Miah, 米亚) entered the **heliosphere** and in 1994 first contact with humans were made, at which time Tao Ye was 12 years old and can only faintly admire what the advanced alien civilization can bring to earth, however, only 2 years after Miah arrived, Kruks followed and the situation on Earth (or the solar system) suddenly become very tense. The Kruks invaded many parts of the world up until 1996 when a local balance was temporarily achieved, only to last less than a year, then in 1997, only 3 years after the first contact and before many things settle to ground, The Noble War erupted due to disagreeing forces on the Alien's arrival and some parties' strong desire to complete remove both or either of the species due to ecslated conflicts (some countries who were not welcoming and falling behind during early contact with Miah made alliance with Kruks and later bring the conflict into full-scale wars). Every since late 1996, lots of things starts to change, politics become very unstable, economics suffer, and trust is low. The year 1997 is when lots of things change for lots of people, full-scale wars erupt in Toronto and many other major parts of the world, and lots of locals are captured into **The Blue Mountain** for human labours (done by Kruks instead of Miah) soon after. Tao Ye and his classmates were captured after their parents were and after they set up the explosion at the local school, then captured by the Kruks and was teaching Medala culture (the targets were ambiguous at that time, especially with a general hostile consensus against all aliens, it matters not what the school was teaching, and this act is entirely a demonstration of rebellion of the local government and the school's non-acting for protection of locals). It's through the dead bodies of Tao Ye' parents and family the little kid survived, and with the 1st nuclear bomb landed on Vancouver (as a minor threat compared to Toronto) and the loss of Toronto following, the story changed completely. Tao Ye lived a savage homeless life for 2 years (occassionally helped by the close friend of deceased mother/father, former PhD supervisor, **Beatrice Worsley** from the University of Toronto), seeking revenge and rebellion when he can, when he was only 15 years old. In year 1999, the second expendition ship of Miah arrived containing Kun and many other higher levels. With the supreme power of Kun, Kruk forces recede a bit, and the re-construction of both Toronto and Vancouver was in progress. Later that year, as the remaining Medalian people helped reconstruct Vancouver, the second most damaged city after Toronto and the to-be new reserve for Medalian people in Canada, Tao Ye entered Whisper (Toronto) under the guardian of Kirin. It's a peaceful and enjoyable 5 years and the best time of Charle's life after the eruption of the War. He finished Whisper in 2 years, not taking further education there after realizing Kirin treats him only as a friend, maybe a cousin, and instead entered the **University of Toronto** as an electrical engineering student, then left Toronto for Australia 4 years later to pursue a study in Architecture - this departure of Toronto is partly motivated by Kirin's love for a teacher of Architecture and as a means of leaving her for seeking new path. However, the Kruks didn't give up, and they set up an even more horrible attack in 2007, which destoryed both themselves and half the population on earth along with all the Miah people. Kruks came and there was an 8-month war that destroyed almost half the planet. Tao Ye didn't get to meet Kirin one last chance since he's abroad. When Tao Ye finished degree in **Sydney College of Architecture** he was already 25 years old and it's year 2010. The anti-alien voice was high and barely any Medalians were left on earth (at least superficially). Mr. Leng has purchased most of the lands in Vancouver for his reconstruction plan, and with the help of Tao Ye and some others, he managed to purchase the whole land and started the construction of the city.

### Affection/Obsession for Kirin

> 越是得不到就越是想得到. <!--This is VERY STRONG and poisonous self-assertion! It's abusive and addictive and unhealth.-->

To ensure proper impression and sufficient emotional depth - we must have **proper buildup** before we can let Tao Ye meet and have affection for Kirin: we must show that Tao Ye has the emotional need for (female) company. For instance: 1) When Tao Ye first saw Kirin, he didn’t have a feeling because he was focusing on the dating event with Maggie and friends; 2) When Maggie went missing after the invasive event, Tao Ye misses her a lot; 3) After staying with the Kirin family (relunctantly), Tao Ye starts to admire this sister-like character.

What do we mean this is an obsession? We should note a few things: 1) It's a result of fate, in a sense that it's destiny that pushes him towards the decisions he's made in the past and it's destiny that manages to KEPP HIM THAT WAY so all external factors just keep pushing him in that one direction, not giving him chance to turn around or deviating far from his destiny and true ending; 2) It does NOT mean that Tao Ye never had feelings, crushes, or even romantic and sexual relationship with others - in fact he likes 千秋叶君代 - however, most likely than not, those desires for specific women are unfulfilled. What's more, to further strengthen this point - even Tao Ye' non-sexual/non-romantic desire for friendship and companionship of (male) friends CANNOT be satisfied - because he's so special and he CANNOT find people of a smilar mind to him.

{Tao Ye was an international student alone in Toronto (since senior high), and surprisingly enoguh the host family (住家, home-stay) was by this Miah couple (Queen etc), living in slightly big but not exaggerated house. After high school, they got him into the BEST school ever - Whisper, and Tao Ye started to study together with Kirin (Kirin still studies and does research at the school despite age and experience). 

Everything else happens are usual school stuff - sometimes stupid, but in general fun and memorable. The crux of the emotional attachment here is thus no longer a sick subject-servant relationship, but a mutual affection: that Kirin treats Tao Ye as a young family member, while Tao Ye deeply admire this big sister. However, all the romance arcs happens independently (Kirin with her own romantic life, Tao Ye with his own childish stuff at school, e.g. the prom party), and they never get romantically together despite all the intimacy they had. This is thus a very good foundation for strong attachment and sweet, positive memories. So when Kirin died while trying to leave earth (we need to think about the execuse that why on earth they don't try to carry Tao Ye with them), that's a grave loss.} (Refer to https://nine.totalimagine.com/ArtOfAI for some threads of development)

### Assist Mr. Leng during NFC Devlopment

In year *2022* to *2032*, Tao Ye lived closely with Mr. Leng on F2 at *The Courtyard of Turtle Tiled Glass* for continuing development for the city. It's in year 2025 that Mr. Leng adopted Catherine Leng, then 9 years old. 3 years later due to an occasion Catherine Leng gradually starts to develop a romantic feeling (more than the original closeness) towards Tao Ye and had their first sexual encounter at age of 14 (2030). Tao Ye moved down to F1 when Catherine was *16 years old* (ca. 2032), slightly closer to its now-employed **The Architecture School of Whisper** and live alone in a dedicated quiet neighbourhood **The Hermit (Seclusion) Park** in his own house **Urban Solitude (No. 5)**. Tao Ye always had this unusual sexual and intimate relationship with Catherine Leng, which was at least partly known to Mr. Leng, who didn' bother this much.

### Sexuality

<!--This section needs serious development - Tao Ye unusual life path shapes his very unusual sexuality affinities and unique sexual and romance behaviors, partly affected by the fact of he NEVER had any romantic relationship.-->

Sexual orientation: Asexual/Self-sexual/Auto-sexual by choice. He is one of those very rare sexual orientations. (Comment, #20240105) Don't know when you came up with this idea but I thought I first came up with asexual just the past week😂 Aka. Tao Ye is definitely asexual per our own sexual experience at the end of 2023.

> Most people are skin shallow - when they like someone, they want to have sex with them.

Not for any particular reason - maybe some people are just asexual by nature.

(Remark, #20230304) Now we have better exposure to aesthetics (e.g. from training from CGPB), I think we should be more careful in our coverage of sex in our work - ideally be more subtle.

### (Architecture, Achievement) 查尔斯主持设计/建造的建筑

* 若是假设查尔斯专注建筑设计事业30年、又有冷家的支持所以可以大展拳脚建设，则其最多的时候每5-10天就有一个新设计，30年就可以有600+的建筑积累。
    * 风格丰富、类型全面，涉猎广泛。
* 注意设计和建筑往往不是一人之功，除去查尔斯之外，九层楼珺胤也经常出现似乎是某个霸气的设计团队，以及威斯波尔建筑学院的学生所有参与实际设计。
* 主要方向：文化、新内容（九层楼特异性）、旧区改建
* Note all of the work are well-known or famous; But generally people know that: 1) Tao Ye or the architecture firm behind him does A LOT OF designs for NFC; 2) Some of the Tao Ye’ famous work are well known.

**List**

1. Garden Housing Complex (GHC)
2. New Age Building新时代大楼/先驱大厦
3. 市贸大厦
4. 土道大厦（基于原先？？设计的TD大楼改造）

Favoured by young people. (idea from) Charlotte's research into robotics in Architecture envisions some kind of smart-technology drive non-perpetual style, compared to more old-fashioned long-lasting construction methods and traditional mechanical structures.

值得留意的是这些建筑并不是查尔斯参与设计的

1. 九层楼图书馆
2. 水镇
3. 五层以下

### 特性

性格、习惯、表现。

* 最爱中世纪欧洲古典室内建筑，每当谈及总有一种神游天外的样子，也时常那般演绎，对其中的历史、设计细节、材料等娓娓道来
* 不在讲室上课，而都在礼堂
    * 第一排靠中间过道第一个座位总是空留着
* 一个人着手设计了九层楼三成的建筑，终生以建筑为事业
    * “我特别喜欢你们地球的建筑，各种各样的，不似我们（？？？天来主星）那儿、都是？？？的，中规中矩”
* 语言风格: 寻常时候、以及文字信息交流，查尔斯张给人的感觉是有些违和的“正式，特别正式”，尤其是跟其他角色的口语（以及萧衎平时带点地方特色的表达）相比较。

### 人物特征

* 精致都市风格？初见时穿着风格普通（后来发现、流行、传统、汉服、混着穿）
* 高度守时（另一个是冷先胜）（雪映也很守时）
* Tao Ye跟一个新人单独约见时、尤其刚开始的时候、基本上每次都会穿不一样。Tao Ye似乎总是倾向于迟到。但是除此之外，Tao Ye是一个十分有原则并且性格十分独特的人，作为九层楼的设计者，九层楼的大部分价值观念都是他和雪映共同发展出来的，其中还有一部分也是冷先胜参与的（以一种长者睿智的身份）
* 素食（“i am old, I like original, I want peace”）、家中有侍者（权益关系什么？职责分工什么？）
* 家里虽然很大、很多餐具什么，其实来人也只是很少很少的机会，多半有些奢侈吧
* Tao Ye一生只钟情珺胤（或者说是自责与眷恋），所以即便对别的女子有矛盾的情感、以及后来跟雪映关系亲密，由于这个执念也不能够有所作为、但不能说是无动于衷了吧。美人池在故事里面就算做个传奇，不要多加解释其中人物名称的来源就好。
* Highly Empathetical but not affected by personal impulsive emotions, ''take nothing personally'' (MC物质之上客观理解力)
    * As an extreme, he can eat well while someone is being tortured if he rationally feels he can do nothing about it/he doesn't need/want to do anything about it: no effect as long as it doesn't concerns him directly
* Play some simple but delicate magic tricks (e.g. ???), For he's a friend of ''the magician''.
* ''Privacy'': Tao Ye is the type of person (or the only few) that definitely (seems to) care nothing about privacy, and the type of person that is truly capable of ''living himself'' no matter which world he is in: in his multitude of many many projects and attributions and available productions, one of the piece is a ''live documentary'' of some of the most often visited places (home, architecture school, library, etc.) of Tao Ye and his ''live GPS location''. Such information is archived as well so it's not required to view them live.
    * He appears to the world to be a normal and hardworking person, a lonely character, a dedicated CofN contributor
    * He lives a regular and fulfilling lifr working and studying in the library
    * His working process and talents are all available to whoever wants to learn from him
    * All his work is just result of some ingenuity, and accumulated progressive results (which is from hard to impossible to duplicate the process itself)
    * He can be delicate and takes time organizing stuff and keeps his home clean
    * He writes journals (the visibible part to the world only ''at home'', the other parts unknown to the public when he's at the library) and plans
    * He also appears to be ordinary person with ordinary needs in particular sexual needs - he might never have visited [[醉生楼]] but for all good means he watches [[大禹治水]] and ''masturbates a lot'' (we will design how he appears to others, design his process of doing this masteurbation e.g. 之前做些什么、中途是什么样的神情和自慰习惯、作为一个神态描写可以时而事后很疲惫索然无味直接关掉电脑/收起来资料，也可以其他时候去仍然津津有味的阅读一些额外的故事——以及是否会用到充气或者塑胶娃娃/情趣用品，如果是则''为何不直接去醉生楼？'').
    * Tao Ye虽然在镜头前、但是恍若丝毫不在意的做到完全寻常、自如、按照自己的方式的行为和工作（从来不对着镜头打招呼什么的）
    * 虽然九层楼内如此“极端”做到规避隐私的人并不多（说来对于Tao Ye而言、这些东西都其实不算是隐私吧，而工作的那一部分，去跟人们分享、偶尔也去看一看人们对于其相关工作的动态的即时评论，也是一种启发），但是也有许多人如此学习他来引领一种“无隐私”生活，但是其中也不乏有特殊癖好的人有特殊的目的（例如自我性暴露），形式也会截然不同（例如有的人就是在演绎、还跟观众互动），而像Tao Ye这样能够真的在其行为中给人们带来启发的并不多；[[雪映|冷雪映]]是知晓并且十分赞同他的行为的人
    * 很自然的，雪映和Tao Ye[[那次亲昵行为|冷雪映和Tao Ye]]也是在开放平台上可见的
    * Notice one very important point regarding the plot: his ''live voice'' and PR information is NOT available. This is (officially) because of the "security" reasons (e.g. biological identification and personal DNA are considered too important for security purpose), but the real reason is Tao Ye needs to contact [[冷先胜]] from time to time and dispatch instructions to underground works, though he never visits such places himself directly (because his GPS location is available but ''anywhere outside his home'' people don't have access to his real-time imagery I.e. what he's actually doing).
    * 只有声音没有图像，因为不需要互动，也因为避免不必要的信息存储，也因为这样有些事情避免些不必要的透露风声的麻烦（但是一般不会在这儿展现出来）
    * 萧衎之前看Tao Ye不爽（因为吃冷雪映的醋）时在开放平台上搜索无意中发现了Tao Ye的这个Channel，观察过一段时间，在那儿我们可以透露下上述的一些元素。

### Identities

<!--We might use some of those ideas on other characters-->

1. （楼外）[[LY]]公司《九层楼·名启天设》（经营模拟游戏，和一般现实中的唯一区别是起始资金、可以重来、以及实现速度很快）大型虚拟现实网络游戏设计总监（Actually, is this idea even before The Three Body Problem?）Maybe Tao Ye (as an architect) took the idea from this game and implemented it as a real city - instead of him designing the whole city from ground up.

姓名和原型：不完全个人原型；张曹一刀？
职位：城市功能、布局和外观风格总设计师（一座城市一个人设计、工程量就浩大、风格也因此统一；在这个form之上冷家制定城市的其他层面、也向下影响物质的form）
喜好：
着装风格：
语言风格：
人物执念：十分在意（自己和他人的）过去：“人不可以遗忘过去，若说过的话、做过的事、有过的感受就这样轻易地忘了，那它们的存在还有什么意义！”【MC物质之上、九层楼推荐价值观Remark：首先人可以遗忘过去或者做任何想到的事情，再者存在的意义就是发生本身所以不必考虑未来价值；对个人角度而言、过去的行往往冲动幼稚所以其实并不真的对于自己、他人、大家有积极的影响，拿得起才放得下，人若是想要往前进步就务必能够接受并且主动拥抱改变，变得是外在的行为和内容、不变的是存在的经历体验本身、而不是动机目的情感啥，永恒的是发生后所被这个世界记录下来的物质状态、而并非是人的心；其实Tao Ye这个执念也好理解、因为太在意一些事情、太不舍得失去，但正是因为如此经历愈发的贫乏、以至于他如何如何了得却不过是一个九层楼的概念设计和执行者、并非正统文化的缔造者】（这儿必然不可以是一个矛盾、即让Tao Ye违背自己设定的九层楼标准价值体系而重新回到冲动的观念状态、虽然其实这只是一个思维模式的twist，在于作为成熟行为体的人物不倾向于如此的）（Tao Ye作为九层楼的设计师提供的是所有美观、外在层面的东西，这样的话他的作品为了纪念谁也好、含有怎么样偏好的内容也好，都是他的乐趣；正统价值观和行为模式则是冷家定义的、雪映尤其为上引领其中的理解力；他跟她之间的矛盾则因此是观念深处带来的矛盾、才华再如何、也终究不是她的菜；我想雪映在确认得知Tao Ye十分在意她的过去之后是不会太伤感的、或许有点失落一点失望，但也并没有什么值得太过于在意、毕竟她敬仰的是他的才华、感动的是他的真情、却无法跟他分享的是一种理解力；只是这般渲染、俩人的矛盾或许不会表现的那般激烈、多一些理性就是——尤其是从雪映的视角描述这一切的话）（以及全书最终的情绪到底该如何：战争之后悲情的所有人受到伤害、还是真正圆满的结局、如何promote一种客观平和的理解力和世界观念以及思维模式、还是这样一种内外世界的矛盾和人性根本的不可调和始终存在而且激烈，就需要去掂量）
人物主要经历：
年少失去双亲（或者仅仅是母亲）、冷先胜看在他是。。。的儿子所以好心收留。
母亲年轻、娇小可爱，一度一个优异的女生，20岁时爱上了一个比她大5岁的男子、沉迷不可自拔，献了身、怀了孕，然而男人并不十分疼爱她、日子并不开心；6岁时将母子抛弃。后来女王入侵，机缘巧合（这儿需要elaborate一下，最好有个solid的可以接触的理由，我不喜欢对上面就开始发展的），成了知心之交（冷也竟然从来没有碰过她、先知道她已婚和有儿子然后才继续喜欢上？）；失踪后收养了她的儿子。
人物特质：家里一尘不染、精神和物质洁癖。
（如此天真）“你为什么不早说！你为什么要欺骗我！”（可知她的委屈：早点也没法说、也没咋骗你啊）
家/XXX（家名）特点：
- 美人池：（刚见到）对外人他都只是给名字、“这条叫做珊珊、这条叫做大黄“、“因为可爱”;（某次鱼儿们消失不见；也可以是后来发现的时候刚好看到原来是这样的、这样两个传奇凑在一起）（传奇）泪水落入池中便会变成鲤鱼;（这个不是直接描写、而是对照、情感细腻却不轻易落泪）从来只为女子落泪（失去的、而非得不到的）;（他不在时、通过一些线索逐渐发现、然后以我的口吻点明）后来发现其实他的每条鱼都对应着一个人；（可以是自己的灵魂看到、也可以是通过后来朋友她人的口吻叙述）（传奇）以为我不再了、陌陌一个人在池边落泪、结局还是个完满的、因为毕竟还会回来、不过沮丧一段时间；人死了还能做什么纪念？；主线（之一）看似是关于雪映、其实也是这一过程中逐渐去了解Tao Ye、他的世界和过去、两个人之间的交集（九层楼三个传奇：九层楼本身、记者口吻，冷家和冷雪映、，三段爱情、雪映口吻、Tao Ye）

### 陶冶（待命名）

**(Old Notes)**

* Tao Ye家是一个现代简洁和东方古典结合的建筑风格，主要参考日式的一些室内设计哲学和元素（参见[[九层楼建筑]]）。走进庭院，可以见到一潭几丈见方、清澈见底、池中有鲜花、水草、鲤鱼的水池名叫[[''美人池''|美人池]]。
* //Tao Ye家的名称、一个更为好听的称呼待议//。
* 风格：庭院、结合自然、''古典现代并存''(what does it mean?)，简约
* Setting与环境：
* 功能需求：

* 部件灵感：地下室，实验室，庭院，车库，现代宽阔，鱼池，自然与建筑结合，拥挤市区（而不是开阔地带、悬崖边上、湖泊旁、那儿可以设计一个设计Studio倒是，这样实验室不妨也放过去）
* School of Architecture and Studio of Design: Iron man-like archi design? Also see http://tomorrowab.cgsociety.org/art/architecture-3d-studio-vizulisation-photoshop-archviz-vray-lindholmen-technical-school-kub-architects-17755739
* 浴室：二段式隔间，外面有bench可以更衣方便；跟卫生间不在一起，外面的隔间是洗衣机和洗手池
* 卫生间：卫生间里有一股淡淡的草莓香味/甜味（不需要额外的解释，灵感来源starberry lube）

帮别人设计的家：

* 参见超人总动员3的别墅
* 家里可以有别墅

**(New Notes)**

1. 陶冶坐落在城市东北角一个安静的“郊区”里面的一个角落，是一个极具现代气息的棕色建筑（参见Architecture Academy、NC Dinning Hall），占地面积超过。。。
    * 注意到OP里面可以hide个人identity，但是行为的一些Record还是存在，例如CofN里面CP最高的前10个人里面有9个都是hidden的。Tao Ye自然是那个没有hidden的。
    * 这个区域超过半数的房子都是查尔斯设计的。陶冶里面有个电梯（门）。门前的two lane小道是支持半自动驾驶（区别于完全自动——待术语，例如unsupervised）的Super highway（道路四周、包括巡航系统会时刻即时检测路况和汇报cross over的人）。房子在一片小树林之间、不临水（因为毕竟吧，不能什么都有）
    * 查尔斯附近、千秋叶住的房子，完全不是千秋叶的贡献能够afford了吧。那个房子、和式的，是冷先胜（九层楼CP排名不在系统之内）要求的、后来安排给这个姑娘居住。（所以查尔斯知道她跟他认识、来历不明，但这不影响他被她吸引）
    * 另外查尔斯这种“有钱人”是可以拥有自己独占的vehicle的，所以（第一层）basement的一半是个车库。另外这个区域方圆500米之内（跟千秋叶家共享的范围）所有人进入、不论匿名状态，都会其location对于地域owner/occupirr可见。
    * 全息投影在九层楼是不存在的（也或许根本不可行，但是我们或许有别的方式emulate），但是为了辅助设计Tao Ye主要有三种特殊的设备：2D动屏桌、大面积Designer OS （名为？）（参考概念那个茶杯放在桌子上面会有感应的），这个最主要；一个虚拟现实Room、提供specialized virtualization（包含投影）environment；以及同样重要的一个特殊的3D visualization physical 装置：一个底部通电的桌子，以及一系列specially made/printed/premade金属和塑料组合的component（以及常规的component）——这些component用手抓着hover在邻近接地的component附近几秒钟就会通电然后要么电磁力要么会有伸出机构连接起来（所以跟modular、最先的灵感是完全的Voxel，但是其实不如更为多元的形态来的flexible），然后有一个特殊的小锤子装置/笔，轻轻敲一下一个原件就可以break下来。这个装置可能不如软体的hologram那么flexible，但是可以作为替代沙盘的工具（这个概念的灵感是“engineering scale”而不是“futuristic”，所以启发这种可以实现、给定足够的资源和产出，但未必最高效）。
   * 关于visualization技术也参见"projectnine, subject, hologram". 注意陶冶不可能全是这种——经典美和simplicity、static也很重要装饰，这样避免动态造成的distraction。
    * 关于写作表现的方法，对这个建筑的描写自然不能挤在一起，但是可以：1）第一次见的时候给一整个自然段（几百个字）大致详细表层布局的介绍包括入门之后看到的左右等；2）这样类似的自然段大概有四个、当每次觉得到达相应位置时进行描述；描述会重点包括方向和具体位置；3）内容的意义除了表现人物（习性、性格、喜好、生活、经历、回忆、perks、文化、宗教、来历背景、价值观念、修为修养）、暗衬一些主题之外，更有意义的其实是设计本身如果可以新颖有趣出众最好；4）额外细节、包括拿起来的东西和对话、交互过程中会经历的事物，则在发生时一两个词描述出来。5）这样一种、陶冶作为描述的套路，每到一个其他重要的地方也根据重要性和细致程度（建筑本身的价值）分配1-4个自然段的笔墨来描写，例如冷家（这个可能远不止四个自然段）、九层楼图书馆、维斯波尔、千秋叶君代家、以及其他许多九层楼的建筑（这方面的笔墨大可不必节省、倒是下狠功夫设计出彩），内容数目积累出来、就看出味道了。6）一个指导的线索是：布局上要描述到plotable、事物则使用形容词和一些术语点明形象、功能或者其他特性即可。
(Remark, #20220117) Notice this is later changed (during 2021 Deep Dive development period) and referred to as a group of specific architecture style of houses that Tao Ye designed.


Other idea elements:

* Home: Shooting range.

### Delicacy

* Home: Letter Opener (拆信刀)：。。。。(形态描述); More relavant see Topics in [文房具](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%87%E6%88%BF%E5%85%B7); * 衣橱是两扇门打开可以进去的更衣间，里面有很好闻的海盐和鼠尾草的香水味
* 家里院子里养了一只黑色的中华田园犬？（或者冷家[[张姨]]家养了一只白色的狗）
    * 灵感来源：中国禁养中华田园犬什么笨和凶，但是小样可不是；禁止的话对于已经养了的人而言难道杀了？
* (Habit) E.g. Dialogue with Catherine Leng: “拜拜”“晚安”（查尔斯惯用拜拜道晚安因为入睡是去另一个世界的游览）

### 轶事/Trivia

<!--This part can be merged into "Briefing of Character Life Path" section-->

* （梦）自从雪映来了之后、他的梦就经常出现她（他或许有个公开的Dream Journal，或者就是某次雪映拜访的时候读到；注意到其中的描写除了展现感情、联系之外也暗示个俩人不好的结局？、以及最好再Serve些别的功能）
* （梦）“我们分开太久、以至于我都不记得你在我梦中是什么样子了，胤”（在某次梦的结尾提到的）
* 他有社交媒体Group名称为：“Tao Ye的后宫群（一）”、“Tao Ye的后宫群（二）”及从属。He gives lots of gifts at major holidays to his fans. This is a play of words because he's asexual.
* 对雪映在以前小时候有一个nickname：小雪映（XXY），在她长大（10岁以后）后有意识的(because he's very careful to avoid unintentional attributions, per The Moral Construct)改口为“雪映”。

### Quotes

> (Personal Experience, Legend, The Dream Institute) "There are places I've been and things I've done that you cannot possibly imagine/that the commoners can hardly imagine." (Wild and fantastic lands, killing and others) <!--This sounds absurd and arrogant if we consider it merely as "dreams" as we usually experience it: but for a trained master, it's truly memrable experience with concrete details and hightened sensations.-->

### Appearance

* 一块紫色/青色的？？？玉佩（母亲留给他的）
    * “这是母亲在世时（留）给我的，也是我和从前那个世界唯一的联系/符号/物质记忆”
    * 她跟Tao Ye认识这么久，经从来没有疑惑过他的父母是怎样的。
* [[3600相]]（雪映的哲学世界中则有另外[[1800]]相不同的表现）
    * I don't live/do something for fun, or for pain; I do it because it's hard
    * [[众生相]]：30相
* ~~雪映觉得他的一颗小虎牙让他有时显得很可爱~~<!--This is NOT sexy! Even 千秋叶君代 might not want to bring it up because when they met Tao Ye' already about 40 years old - it's inappropriate to consider an old Tellurian man who's super professional and was a famous designer as "cute". As such, it's especially not possible for Catherine for feel this way for him - all Catherine can think about might be Tao Ye' male hermone and maturity.-->

### Brief of Life Path

(PENDING DETAILS)
(More details pending construction at Events Timeline)

* After establishing the now-non-officially-published-but-still-official standard of the 5-year nurturing program of adopting new members; Tao Ye started to regain his recognition status by redoing the process himself.

### 设计和塑造重点

* Tao Ye不喜多话，很多他做的事情都是不说、但是完成了、他人观察到或者观察不到那些并非是刻意的。这一点的设计主要是反映一个我自己的价值观，这未必是最Social的，但是自有其坚守的部分；这也是这个人物“悲剧”（literally）的主要成分——由此塑造的个性孤独和不被人理解。另外如果是从这个角度出发，Tao Ye要么不是个公众人物，要么就是即便是个公众人物其人物形象表现也必然是看似十分平实中肯、不似张鹤那般“显著”、但是仔细观察可以发现所有的细节都是因为太完美准备和演练到自然呈现和化归为内在的一部分而甚至并不会让人们意识到这背后的练习和努力和背景的存在——“天才（就是这般）“，人们如是理解，因为他们无法看到伟大成就人背后的成长轨迹、特殊情境、以及卓越的奋斗，不论是”艰苦“还是”先天优越“的，成就是人逐渐积累的结果。
    * 这一个方面既然要隐晦又想要的的确确显著的表现出来，就得强调十分''突出''和具有''代表性''的细节，以及通过''侧面观察''（而不是能够直接通过事实现象本身）表现。例如[[雪映]]造访Tao Ye时Tao Ye不在家那次、Tao Ye的个人生活和规律、笔记和社会贡献层面、偶尔跟雪映的对话时所流露的内容等。
* For artistic purpose it may or may not make sense to ''use a different name for this character'' (so that when people who know me reads this story they don't immediately builds a connection, which obsecures their appreciation of the character in the story)
* （重要背景Fact）Anything worth some real value must be realized through a ''whole team's long-term effort'' (and personal dedication of course, but to a lesser extent in our telling). Tao Ye must necessarily not fight alone.
    * His early friends from that previous time (when he went to Whisper he secretly helped some other survivors? Or is he ''truly alone'' at that time?)
    * [[A whole team]] at his direction in [[CoN]]
    * His Airi design team
    * His architectural students and other institutional collegues
    * Much more details on above aspects pending serious elaboration

## 人物关系

### Tao Ye和[[雪映|冷雪映]]

* 有一个想法是Tao Ye既然和冷先胜联系紧密，则应该在雪映小时候就会经常拜访见面、对于这个活泼可爱的小姑娘也是煞为喜欢；除非Tao Ye和冷先胜之间的隔阂、以及若是冷先胜并不如何表面上参与九层楼事务，那么俩人才会不如何解除。但是我觉得后者不太合理，一来。
* 所以雪映自幼对于Tao Ye甚为亲近，尤其是这个叔叔脑海中各种新奇和优越的价值和行为观念对于雪映的成长有甚大的影响，以至于后来雪映对于Tao Ye产生了爱慕之情。
* 雪映自然是以前就去过Tao Ye家的，也自然是十分喜爱这个古典和现代、精致和简约并存的建筑和室内装饰风格。这样后来雪映再去摆放的时候、发现那一扇门、灵感突然来想到召唤Airi，该不是偶然，而是突然来的主意。她自然也是对Tao Ye的家已经熟悉不过了。
* 我觉得雪映和Tao Ye之间的这种既有亲情又有友情又有爱情的关系和感情基础很重要，也为了后来他俩之间的性爱的温柔、浪漫、和其中蕴含的关于伦理和个人观念的种种复杂情怀做铺垫。

## [[传奇元素|Aspects of Legends]]

一般意义而言九层楼里面的Tao Ye并不是如[[冷先胜]]那样有玄幻传奇元素的人物，其传奇性主要在人格、设计能力、以及过往在[[威斯波尔时期]]的一些经历。但是这儿我们给出一点点小的颇为玄幻/魔幻元素，并不特别关联主要情节，纯粹做一点有趣的艺术性点缀、增加写意境界。

* 鲤鱼：[[美人池]]里那些灵动可爱的鱼儿相传是Tao Ye的眼泪化作的；这一部分给一个风光的男人增加一点柔情。这个元素对应的意向是对那些人物的情怀。
* 梦：Tao Ye某次在梦中获得一本奇书[[梦境重游]]，相传这本书是他创作的来源。这个元素对应的意向其实就是取材于梦，但以书来指代；也暗含这本书可以带领穿越梦境无穷界与现实界。

在故事作品里如果想要这两个元素显得不是那么的trivial、太不经意，则需要在其他两处以不同的形式再点映一下：

* 楼里其他一些地方可以有鲤鱼（[[醉生楼]]就可以有很多鲤鱼）、顺着任意一个Narrator的视角在看到时提点一下就行
* “梦”这个元素可以以毫无传奇色彩的方式提点 例如一对恋人早晨交谈夜晚梦到的内容，或者萧衎冲动的跟雪映提到梦到她。以及雪映就总是莫名梦到一些事情然后就按照梦中的指引去行为例如萧衎醉生楼那一段这也可以是个理智和寻常灵感创意之外的引子（那会儿雪映梦到的对象可以不是萧衎，但用在了萧衎身上）
* Dream Inspired Creation: “你记这么许多梦有什么用？梦中的世界再美好，故事再精彩，醒来不也都没了？”
    * “我们的生命和许多经历不也就像是一场又一场的美梦？发生的当时再美好，若是后来失去了，那不就跟梦境一般？我们可以选择当时好好体验，也可以事后回味。”
    * 更何况，谁说这些都只是虚无的——你会不会有时一觉醒过来感觉自己很开心，有时候又觉得有些失落。是否是梦在不知不觉中改变/影响了我们？
    * 梦境的聆听者往往无法区分和现实的区别/梦中人往往不知道自己是否在做梦，你又如何能够区分现实和梦境的区别？
    * “梦对我而言其实是一种灵感——一种带我去体会和看到平时看不到事物的地方。平时在现实中身边的种种事物太耀眼让人分心，只有在梦中我们才是真正的平静下来，才是一种不受到外界干扰的''纯粹的自我''”
    * 所以对我而言，现实即是一场梦，梦也是一种现实。不经历就不知道什么是可能的，不幻想就不会去启发行为——所以我用梦境来启发现实，用现实来增强和丰富梦境。故事中的人若是没有名字，我就学着去给她一个名字；梦中的事物如果不够清晰，我就学着去更细致的（在现实中）观察。
    * 这一段相关内容如果在[[故事中|（小说）九层楼志]]提到，则可以摘录一些比较精彩有趣的梦的片段、也可以摘录一些关于梦的学习、星体投射的笔记，由此反应Tao Ye对于梦境这一种媒介的exposure广度和深度，启发读者。
    * 那一夜雪映做了一场梦，她梦到（结合故事情境和上下文）Tao Ye去了一个遥远的地方，梦到自己醒来想要去找他说这个梦，但是却见到了萧衎（？）。。。。她醒来后觉得惊奇，跟？？？说。

## Time Periods

### Junior High School

(PENDING)

### Orphanage Education

(PENDING)

Tao Ye讨厌以前的高中/孤儿院，所以后来有钱了再回到（多伦多），就把那儿拆掉，给Zarna盖了座宫殿。 (idea from) OTPP对我很好，去纽约还报销。要是有个女人也对我这么好，我就在市中心给她盖座宫殿。盖在多伦多市中心的话，先把多大扒了。

### High School (Whisper)

* Invented his own encoding language (not a complete language but more like an encryption with some shorthand vocabs) at high school when planning rebellions with his other folks.

### After Time Travel

After time travel Tao Ye adopted a Medalian name, see "Ela Bu".

## Personal Life Path Timeline

(Should incorporate directly the Back In Time perspective because in our universe time is a consistent concept)

* (Story, Tao Ye, #Real World) Created ABOR Community 1-3 Fund for experimental setup of corporative scheme. Created Infinite Fund for backing up all other funds. (See Voice recording 20230615)
* (Story) Later in NFC Tao Ye might have lost liu's robotic arm that zarna gave him (this is not developed, just an idea - we may or may not have this plot arangement).

### Topic: Back in Time

(PENDING)

## Religious Belief

Tao Ye believes that "our world is created by an outside being, which sets the order and progression of everything", what's more, he once mentioned that "maybe we live in a novel, but one that's so sophisticated, you cannot tell whether we are acting according to some plot, or we are acting spontaenously".

We are yet to come up with a story how he gained this insight, but what matters to the people surrounding him is that: 1) He firmly has this belief and acts accordingly; 2) He created TLO to conduct what he believes is the right course of action or the 传承 of his understanding of the nature/morality of his world, 3) To the outsiders, he appears to be religious, but he knows what he's referring to - though he couldn't quite pinpoint what exactly that might be.

## Notes

* Label: Legendary Character, Hero
* (Native) Native Name: Charlos Hung
* (Comment, Name, #Change-Request) Honestly Tao Ye doesn’t sound as impressive as Charles Zhang.
* (Name, Proposal) Since Tao Ye would be too explicit a self-reference, and we mentioned it can be revolting to some readers - I think it's ideal to change the identity into **Tao Ye** in the novel.
    * (remark, 20210804) This is especially relevant since we are going to have decent satire mentioning of Chinese political issues - in that case hiding personal identity, even if not so intentionally but at least be somewhat discreet, is necessary.
    * (Remark, 20210804) Also for the name of the author of the novel, it can be "**曲蚕山**" to avoid sounding too "网文" (i.e. v.s. 蚕山曲轻).
* (Remark) A likely central conflict between Tao Ye and Kirin and thus the “unresolvable” story between the (as something better, more profound while still grounded on the personal level), could be that: Kirin will live forever (both practically and figuratively), while Tao Ye won’t - If the Adult Tao Ye is aware of this, then his work and effort in building something as “long-lasting” as Kirin would make more sense (e.g. a city, a book). This in term, if developed well, could evolve in the central theme of the whole work: life and death, limited time yet unlimited interest and unbounded universe, how we must die, and how we wish to live and persist forever, yet how life is ultimately boring (we may or may not want to stress the “lonely” aspect of it, since the goal of this work is to promote such an eternal love, while loneliness, despite a necessity, is a secondary).
* (Todo) Extract certain events from this character to put into Events Timeline project.
* (Todo) <!--Pending merging with `EID2020121901_K-P9KMD`-->
* (Quote, idea) (Per The Last Order and his experience) If you believe in something strong enough, faith cannot be affected by others' words. (CZ)
