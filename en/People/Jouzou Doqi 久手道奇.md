Mother of Zarna Doqima (多奇玛).

# Description

<!--(Remark) Jouzou's background sounds too simple and straightforward (or maybe not simple enough). Need a bit more artisy in this story. (Remark) Consider add more flesh and a little bit of twist. Though in general as some 武术之人 it makes for a life of devotion so we should in general keep it as clean and as straightforward as possible.-->

**Jouzou Doqi** (Romanization: Jozo Doqi 久手多/道奇), who on her own is quite a character in the Medalian world (after all, her daughter is the to-be-queen, she can't be too bad) - Jouzou was born into a rich government family (the half-political, half-business Doqi family, which is not a particularly large family but serves some very non-trivial purpose) on Kai but not interested in inheriting the family duty (well but she has many/a few brothers and sisters so no need to worry much about it). Since very young Jozo has shown great talent in the art of "**Minbi Eyok**" - a local form of self-defensive combat, her master was the then known "*Red Fist Man*" (赤拳道人) Shannakon/Shankon (善空) <!--(Comment) This sounds too much like Japanese, consider shorten to Shankon.--> (not real name, of course, this is his artistic name). 

After winning so many local and inter-planetary competitions, she later joined **the Asabi Army** (270YA) for a while to test her combat in real battles (you can imagine the great trouble she went through in this with her family), and joined the war against Kruk in the Orio Galaxy, where she met her love-of-life (*lafuria*, spouse), Kirin's father, the general of the army, and a tough figure, **Iko Osawa**, who she married and she then becomes a military-appointed trainer for the army and stayed in the base on Yei until she give birth to Zarna, after which she returned to Kai to live with her family, bringing Zarna with her (notice the capital of Mufansa Ti Medala is on Kai).
