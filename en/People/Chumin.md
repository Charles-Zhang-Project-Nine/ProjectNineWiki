# Chumin

Tags: People, Non-NFC

A human girl who's ugly and one of those days, she can realize her dream by changing her appearance completely - by becoming a Kruk (Cybrog), or thanks to Krukian technology, she can get a revamped body (cybernetics).

She can be a highly influential pop-culture idol and somewhat rich, but apparently lots of media criticism.

(How can someone like her to have enough influence and given an appropriate channel of speech, voicing her gratitude to Krukians in a way that's touching? One ordinary way would be when she's on a show, talking like trivia, a more dramatic way would be when she's protecting and standing out for Krukian rights and get trialed by the public and defend herself, even sacifice in conflicts)

<!--(Theme) (PENDING RECOLLECTION TO Legends of NFC THEMES) Such a character also depicts another major potential and argument for Kruks' way of life (expecially the "perfect" version of Cybrog) - **a person's traits and all qualities is no longer determined by gene, you can swap any part of yourself to make yourself as ideal or as bizarre as you want** (like 修真者 in 漂渺之旅). There is only one catch, and since everything has a cost - if you are not fortunate enough to be born with those desirable traits (both by yourself and by others), and if you are not born with a wealth of fortune, then you need to work extra hard **JUST TO GET THAT CHANCE OF REINCARNATION** - you spend 30 years to gain a status (like we spend 10 years just to become PR of Canada), and then you can spend all that money to start over again, within a new configuration. The good news is that this time, (hopefully) you get everything you needed - it's going to be another fresh new start now you don't have anything, BUT you have knowledge, you have experience, and as a Kruks, you never die, meaning **you have time to make everything right**. (Comment, #20230905) This is fucking awesome. -->

Notes:

* (Inspiration) [《万万没想到》第三季：第二集 白雪公主的阴谋](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHLVDVLgaS8&t=167s) - how will it feel if one of those days you look into the mirror and ALWAYS see a reflection of a very beautiful person? Even if you have been ugly and dispised upon for the past 20-30 years? You were never liked, and it might take some time to adjust and become truly confident without no skill or quality - but simply just being there and being beautiful. Soon you will transform from someone who's shy and quiet to being able to utilize such physical trait for personal advantage. (Comment, #20230905) Contrary to what I hypothsized - it is exact THE REALITY of people who are born pretty when not cultured right, they are talentless and useless but just pretty and good at being pretty (and show lots of other adorable feminine traits).
* (#20230905) If the conflict is going to involve violence, then this character is better set OUTSIDE NFC, for NFC is a relatively peaceful place and do not require such violent resolutions. E.g. she can live in some Korean/China like quickly developing country, borrowing lots of new ideas from the western world.

## Naming and Etymology

* (20230905) We had an unused name idea "lovely", maybe good for her. E.g. Generally something like "Lovely", "Charming" (春名, Chumin) etc.

## Chapter 2 of Chumin's Life: Event at the End

As a potential plotline, she's suddenly popular, exremely charming, then criticized as being non-human, and politically taken and publicly charged and trialed, and finally tested to death - on her last day, she was literally torn apart, shown all mechanical/electrical parts, and not shedding a single blood, then on her final execution moment, some Krukian controlled eagle/flying beast took her away and killed a bunch of guards. After that, she's saved by Krukians and replaced and become a complete Krukian. That will open the Chapter 3 of her life.
