Names: Source Code, 源

He is a traveler between worlds <!--Try not make this sound like a profession, but more like a hobby, hermit style.-->, very reputable and protected person - he is a book-keeper <!--Try not make this sound like a profession.-->. Source made many friends across centuries, and has contact to many Kruks - he event kept many older versions of code copies for them. Source has very sophisticated live storage system but what’s even more impressive is his own secret keep where true treasures of knowledge lies. He’s most recently a traveler to Tellus.

## Art Collection

Source is also a bit digital art collector - big fan of 2D sophistication (e.g. think of pixel art). <!-- (Inspiration) Things like Figure art and dollhouse or 成人拼装玩具 are cute to do once in a while - or when we are kids and can't craft things more sophisticated or lack artistic crafts. In pure 3D/digital DCC medium, however, we have full freedome and complete control over scale (though arguably it will take longer to learn and produce pretty settings compared to just buying preset miniature furnitures). Eventually, however, we are collectors of what's appealing and creating scenarios out of them. -->

## Notes

* If I want to do it well, or mention this character at all, I must given FULL EXPOSURE so we understand this is no trivial character.
* (Comment, #20231216) Is this the one I had the impression of being a huge in-space single-station entity? (Comment) On the other hand, I think in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy might have an identity similar to this.
