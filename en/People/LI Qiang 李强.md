# Li Qiang 李强

Tags: People, Tellus, NFC

Publically known as the spokesman of NFC and travels around to the outside world frequently, Li Qiang is secretly a huntman that targets political figures and enemies of NFC. He's an outgoing, bright and energetic handsome big guy on the outside, but a cold and efficient killer inside.

## Notes

* Notice the figurative impression of Li Qiang should be very different from Kiritsugu Emiya from Fate/Zero - they are equally skills assassins, but Li Qiang's appearance is more refined and he's also personally more high profile.
