全名：张大福

(PENDING COMPLETE RENAMING: WE MIGHT DISREGARD ALL THOSE NAMES AND RECONSIDER AND RENAME ACCORDING TO KANIT CONVENTIONS AND LAST NAME RULES - 萧衎，萧何娜，张老爷，胡祖豪，赵倩雅，孙俊杰，赵世强，孔先生 and everyone related to Xiao Kan in general)

张老爷是政府高官，but his real passion (besides pretty girls) (actually he HAS TO BE Xiao's real father for his mom to NOT BE ABLE TO TOLOERATE HIS SUCH BEHAVIORS) - which he takes seriously, is to do business in The Legenday Substance (which we shall name as, and describe EXACTLY as marijuana and differentiate between other substances). He always said: 小隐隐于田，大隐隐于市，而官场给了我可以享用我最爱的两样事物的渠道.Eventually, he has to escape to NFC, and after submitting all his incomes, he lives a decent (and sensual) life.

## Notes

* 张老爷 plays an 二胡 - pentatonic scale. (Where did he pick up this skill? The only way it make sense is he's a 知识分子 and he learnt this when he was doing 知青下乡 or during university/青年 age)
