# Ora Chamurika

Tags: People, Medala, Myah, #Medalian Queen

Chamurika is the first Medalian Queen that comes from an ordinary family in the selection contest, not genetically modified embryo. The impression on her (appearance) is she's more of a mild/cute/approachable looking woman (compared with other queens who look more noble or high maintainence or 高冷 or simply nothing like a human fleshed body).

(Not sure whether this should be attributed to Chamurika or Kun VI - who's a golden/gold faced woman) Chamurika is a "science nerd" or to put it nicely, very very obsessed with physics and adept in physical constrcts. During her terms and kept refining afterwards through Kun VI and Kun VII's terms, she initiated the quite a few big scale physical constructs (with the help of Hyupeda either directly as 点火石 or indirectly as query machines), 

1. QuanmCom: A mechanism that allows faster-than-light-instantenous information transmission.
2. Neurocleanser (Legendary): A mechanism that can reset time at local space region.
3. Gateway (Legendary): A mechanism that allows one teleport between galaxies.
4. Time travel (Legendary): A mechanism that allows one travel to the past.

## Romance

(#Undeveloped, Proposal, Idea, #20230406) The Fepulans players are above time and space - when we are playing inside our own simulation we are effectively gods, and we can travel anywhere we want though we may choose to be a simple observer most of the time: it would be cool if one of the player fall in love with this extraordinary in-game being (kind of like in Fate/Zero how Gilgamesh wants to become human; In this case the player is still a proud player but it's interested in developing an intimate relationship with one of the Queens).
