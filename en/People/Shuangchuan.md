# Shwangchwan (Pending first/last name)

Tags: People, Medala

A Medalian general/educator that helped establish the first Vandentra-Medala-Alternative School at Vandentra.

## Naming and Etymology

The proto-name for this person was "Shuangchuan". The name "Shuangchuan" is inspired by "Steiner education", where "Steiner" starts with an "s". At the moment it doesn't mean anything yet, since it's just a stub. What matters is the guy is a Medalian and the full name for him should follow medalian convention.

A more phenetically correct spelling for "Shuangchuan" is "Shwangchwan".
