Third-generation queen of Medala. With two generations of effort on perfecting the ??? (queen-making) technique and policies, she's considered the (first) perfect outcome since the inception of the technique. (PUTTING THIS TO DEDICATED WIKI ENTRY) The ??? (queen-making) technique (give it a medalian name) will thus be solid and not changed much untill maybe the fifth or the 7th queen.

* (Achievement) Discovered a way to unlock Ancestor Gene post-fact, thus completely eliminating the prohibitively high cost of embryo development. It also makes Queen-Making Technology a highly contested technology and dreamable even by the mundane. Queen's Treasure is further mystified as a legacy that's hidden away by the second/&third queen.
