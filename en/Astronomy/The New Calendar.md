# The New Calendar

Tags: Tellus World

新历纪法，以“新元年”为起始。

Names: 新历纪法，万年历，大纪元

Notes:

* Note that Tellurian calendar is DIFFERENT from Medalian calender (details of both of which are pending design) - in that case, when an Idian people say he's 10 years old (in Medalian calendar), it's NOT 10 years old in Tellurian calendar - and it's going to be different from 10 years in earth (our world) time.
