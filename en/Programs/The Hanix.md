# The Hanix

Tags: #Medalian, Program, Medalian World

During the early stages of 推行 of the constructed Medalian langauge, there weren't enough language experts to write/speak in Medalian as the official language, also translation work of existing official documents and historical documents can take forever - as such the program Hanix <!--Pending analysis/making up word meaning--> is developed to provide automatic translations from most common source languages into Medalian as a standard reference. The program is very smart and can understand context and semantics to provide most culturally-appropriate translations.
