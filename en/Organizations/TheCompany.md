<!--As of 20220702 I was thinking it would be nice for P9 CG's actual production that we have a role like Art Director who make commands of what we should draw (since apparently otherwise I can easily claim "I don't have inspiration for no shit" and don't draw nothing) - and on top of that if we have higher managers that make demands based on financial terms, then everything can make even more sense and even proceed with more order. For that, we actually can fake a comany structure.-->

TheCompany (name pending) is an organization responsible for actual planning and development of the Project Nine related projects for production purpose.

TheCompany is located on the south-west coast of Audas.

* The company-wise knowledge base and meeting and planning documents and basic file sharing are available under Notion.
* The Company is not concerned with anything related to the author's (aka. CZ) personal scheme - the company only makes plan on the coorporate level.
