Type: Organization

The Xia Family don't use their name explicitly - instead it's associated with a particular organization and works (as a layer of indirection) behind the scene for that organization.

Seperate from the day-to-day operation of the government, it is a representation of further *segmentation/specialization of NFC governing functions*: *culture, diplomacy, economics, executive, law/legislature, judiciary*, *military* <!--The Du-family (which will represent a specific organization, in this case 妒军工 and others) model is an implementation of the Myah's "王意" system, which allows the military to have independant function and responsibility/decision making from the government - we need still to figure out how in this case the city directs/controls/informs the military to do things for it; TO say the least it's going to be a converastion between two leaders: the leader that demands and initiates the request, and the military leader; And we need to figure out how to maintain loyalty and correct interpretation of the military leader and avoid corruption of the military order--> among others.

## Description

**Vision United** is responsible for all kinds of cultural and organizational events (what outside world might call "political", here at NFC due to its unique tech-drive and open-source nature, it's more of an organization thing), here are some enumerations (pending exhaustion):

1. **City Design Conference**: Major events that happens twice a year. Think of this as a combination of The Games Award/E3/Apple Annual Event/XBOX Event (in the third quarter) and SIGGRAPH/GDC (in the first quarter), where we provide both digest, nomination of major developments and technical review and discussion of certain subjects in 3 day (for the release event) and 1 week (for the technical event) period. All kinds of people can participate, mostly those profesionally works in this field and those members from the open-source/dev community who are very interested. The topics here cover mostly the CofN OP platform and all its components.
2. <!--Might need a public informative event on the law system of NFC-->
3. (Cultural festival events organized by the city, including celebrations for Christmas-like holidays; We always need NOT JUST A THEME, but meaning, information, and something new, so we are evolving and not staying in the past; And such events are NOT about any individual people, e.g. we don't just ask some "government officials" to give 冠冕堂皇 speeches but the candidates are chosen from the public from the figures with recognizable contributions in the field by the public)
4. (Year-round seminars on cultural diversity and all kinds of general social issues, aimed at promoting awareness; This is like HR/Culture&Diversity/Inclusiveness training at modern companies; Some can seem quite boring and people comlain about the quality of them)
