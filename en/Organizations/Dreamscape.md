Original funders: Tao Ye, Vince Fan.
Vince Fan was a statistician and Tao Ye was a polymath whose name comes up in many fields.

Dreamscape is a large corporation (although I am not sure what kind of business would it have to attract such huge amounts of revenue - typically in our worlds retailers and social media companies or commerce companies are the ones that can have significant earnings) that specializes in producing "dream-capture" devices that allows a person to capture and playback their dreams as video signals. The general mechanism of these kind of hardwares are that they form a statistical correlation (latter this is mostly achieved with deep learning models) between a person's vision and the physical capture of their surroundings (through a camera). Originally (like many great inventions) it started as a garage project. The company was funded and located in NFC, residing in rent office towers.

Below are two of the most notable iterations of their hardware:

1. In the early generations, the dream capture device (pending a catchy name) requires users to train using their own perceptions by wearing the device during day time to fine-tune their hardwares.
2. The latter (state-of-art) models utilizes the latest machine learning (deep learning) technologies/architectures that trains on abundance of real-world vision-neurological data and enables it to be "zero-shot": it requires only the user to wear it for a few minutes to fine-tune the correlation parameters of the model and will work well automatically afterwards.

Some additional ideas:

* The company might own (or be owned as) a subsidiary that specializes in medical devices that enables blind people to see again through specialized devices.
* The company needs to rely on very advanced and detailed neurological capturing device Dreamwave Scanner (a kind of sensor) to monitor brain activities (mostly visual cortex).
* In terms of the medical science aspect, they also created/purchased a company that specializes in producing special-purpose glasses that enables people with blindness to see again (although this technology is different from passive monitoring of neurological signals since it involves INJECTING neurological stimulations instead, so it's less mature).
