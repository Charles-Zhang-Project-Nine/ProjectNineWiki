**Queen’s Private Army**[[ Might consider call it “The Royal Soldier”.]] are trained at the Royal Academy to study and obey Queen’s Will.
Queen’s Will is not and should never be bound to any specific generation of Queen.  Usually though, they are united around the 当届 Queen and follow orders within the structure of the army. However, Soldiers are encouraged to have personal understanding through deeper study of the subject so in case of crisis and political instability they don’t need to follow orders blindly.

# Notes

* (Remark) Apparently, Queen’s Will is nothing like 中共党章 and has no room and no tolerance for 个人崇拜.
* (Remark, Plot) The Royal Soldier’s obligation to Queen’s Will instead of the Queen give them much of personal interpretation and individual capacity for decisions. This is important when later on Earth different soldiers divide into different groups when a Queen is absent.
