## History

As one of the earliest discoverers of the abundancy of Portkeys, they jump in in time and started gathering all such legendary objects by bribing and trading and hunting and coercing their way throughout civilizaitons to collect all such artifacts.
Each Portkey is somewhat different in both apprent functions and shape.
By distributing (renting) those portkeys with great control, they exhibit tremendous influence on civilizations of all kinds.

Some post-modern civilizations hate them and think the Portkeys are righteously theirs and Zuroqiro just stole from them. But then none can easily prove for only Zuroqiro seems to have better history of each articraft they collect.
