# Life After Death

(PENDING MERGING WITH THEME on the same topic)

## Dated

* (20230814) Per latest construct as illustrated in Legends of NFC 20230814, there is no such a thing as living spirit outside a functional body - though the body doesn't need to be biological. The only exception is if the mind finds an exhibit inside "mainframe", e.g. inside Innerworld, or like Xiramus, can live in the middle of worlds.
