# Super Realm

Tags: Construct

(Originally a dated idea per 20230415, but I think we can skip the "Dated Item" queue and promote it to an official concept directly)

(Project Nine, Idea) (Focus on the picture or reality that this idea depicts while ignoring other more fundamental questions as to why, e.g. it's just like focusing on the pure beauty of romance while ignoring the raw sexual motivations or other practical needs or pragmatical reasons) In a realm where everyone is superpower and capable of completely taking care of themselves and so powerful they can deflect astroids at will. (notice this is even more powerful than the 修真世界 or cultivation life) Then how would people live in that world/realm? Maybe that is a planet - or many planets, shaped arbitrarily by those people? Those people are NOT Fepulans players - yet they are MORE powerful than Xiramus or Medalian Queen. They are gods and even gods live a social life and cannot arbitrarily bend physical world. (Inspiration) Saiki - ain't it cool to have such super powers, in a sense that you are unique and have desirable capabilities. But what if everyone have such capabilities - in that case is such capability still perceived "desirable" or it's just norm? In that case what other things would people desire?

This concept probably will never show up in the canonical novel directly, but it's advisable that some of the higher intelligence or "wanderers of the worlds" are aware of such existence.
