Sex is noble, not morally, but in the sense of the final "reward" - the creators gives us the final pleasure as a reward for achieving the noble goal of delivery life to the next generation. On Tellus, due to mystical/magical reasons, sex can have the following three consequences:

1. (Planted behavior) “大盲” (refers to the spiritual/religious aspect of it)： One or both of the partners will not reach ejaculating orgasm and will die after performing a "programmed procedure", which is to push away the other party, hold his/her hand, and die lying down peacefully with a 大-shape posture. Lots of couples are discovered died this way. Happens to 1/3 or 1/5 of population. See wiki entry Euphthansia on the death/spiritual aspect of it.
2. ???
3. (Intellectural/Natural behavior) “超生”： Per Merveil experience, sex with true love has transcendental effect and immediately grants magical powers to the beloved two. Happens to 1/10 of population. This will happen immediately when it's with the right person at the right moment. Generally speaking, it will happen at first sex with someone new or with a person after a long break (so long that it's capable of changing each others' altitudes on things), i.e. if two have been having sex for a long time and this didn't happen then it's not likely to happen. Such an enlightening effect is called 不疑之征.
4. Just regular boring, exciting, routine sex, likely capable of giving birth to a child if no protection was used. Happens to majority of population.

From above we can derive the following special properties/derivations:

* Unvaccinated sex worker in Tellus is both life-threatening, and both life enabling.
* There is a drug (Supressor) that will prohibt death but also suprress the ability to obtain "enlightening". It's either taken regularly, before sex, one week before sex (like Prep), or through some continue injection or even small operation to completely eliminate the risk.

## Exposition

In terms of writing, one way to truly expose such phenomenon is through the narration of a single personality experiencing sex with different women in this order: regular, Merveil experience, death. We need to focus on how emotions/bonds/attachments are built during the process, personality and altitudes of the other party, and most importantly how the two eventually get hooked up.
