# Naturals

(PENDING MERGING with Wiki topic on Magic)

Individuals born with inherent capacities to take, store, transform and use cultivation energies. Without training, such latent transforming capacities may diminish or remain mundane (but rarely go out of control). Those are one of the first kinds to study and use Cultivation energy in systematic ways and give rise to one of the many branches of "Magic" in our world (A true cultivator learns to store and transcend its own body to becoming a container for Cultivation energy, while a Natural can only convert but not store so they behave like a regular person for the most part, but with fluctuations of emotions etc. they may exhibit special but limited capacities).

Captured naturals may be used as energy converters/generators in the industry (sort of like a profession).
