# Animal Intelligence

(PENDING DECIDING WHICH PLANET GETS TO HAVE THIS FEATURE: IDS OR TELLUS?)

Are their high protein (non-lentil) leafy/green plant substitutes or roots?
Is there still food chain and do animals still eat each other? Is it going to be like wars or simply run-or-be-eaten logic?

To what level is such intelligence measured? Can they make tools? DO they have language?
When combined with magical powers and magical properties, how to balance/mix those?

If animals are highly intelligent almost like humans do, there are two direct implications that's worth exploring: 1) Humans will not eat animal meats, 2) They might have their own micro-societies (without agriculture, it will be like the foraging tribes as ancestors of humans have).
