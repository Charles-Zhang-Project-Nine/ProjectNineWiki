# Tellurian Mythology

(This note would be relevant to the theme/construct of "life after death")

Here are the few mechanisms that blessings work: 

1. Blessings (and curses) are genetic modifications that affects a group of people and can only be passed through 血缘关系.
2. One-time (single person) blessings can be given directly as modifications to a person's body thus gaining new senses or capabilities. This cannot be inherited.
3. Large-scale non-discriminating blessings (and curses) can be manefested as large scale georaphical or through other mechanisms, which targets regions and locations.
4. Gods have the power of leaving legendary beasts behind that guards/protects/monitors her lineage of traditions.
5. Fepulans players generally do NOT possess the power to modify the higher level of emergent spirit resulting from conscious intellect - so they cannot target "spirits", which is a construct.

Some records of types of blessings:

1. Agriculture: This is the easiest and generally can last a few hundred years once implemented. The Fepulans players modifies the landscape and makes the climate/environment more suitable for agriculture growth.
2. Intellect: Fepulans players can directly teach knowledge on agriculture, metallurgy, vehicles, animal husbandary, writing, poetry, etc. (See Civilization 6 technology tree)
3. Artifact: Fepulans players can leave behind legendary artifacts.
4. Beast: Fepulans players can leave behind legendary beasts.
5. Trait: Fepulans players can modify and implement outstanding biological traits, e.g. speed, strength, acute senses.
6. Architecture: Fepulans players can leave behind shrines, architectures, buildings, temples that are made by himself.
7. Tales, Legends, Books, Poems: Tales along with good deeds can be of great inspirational values. Stories of gods living among man is a continuous source of confidence and serve as a good model of act for Gods are perfect and behaves consistently according to certain models (unlike humans, which can easily be shaken or influenced). Their miracles and magical acts also give huamsn hope as to what is possible beyond limits of mundane physical world.
