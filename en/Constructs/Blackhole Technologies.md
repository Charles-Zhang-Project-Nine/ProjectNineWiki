# Blackhole Technologies

Tags: Construct

(We put this under Construct for now for summarization purpose, as we develop more specific notes, we could move them to corresponding Technology entries)

Blackhole is a phenomenon but to the wise and capable they could be a source of resource, to the even more capable they could create blackholes on demand - that's the "blackhole civilization" concept we used to have, where entire civilizations hide inside blackholes or blackhole-like spaces.

Anything we can say about more every-day style black-hole technologies? (As a construct note for now)

* Archaological use: time horizon information
* Black-hole accelerator: A stellar mass black hole could be used to accelerate matter, Some of it will fall in. some of it will be accelerated to extreme speeds. If we had a way to capture this energy, we had an energy source that far exceeds the efficiency of fusion in stars. A stellar mass binary could be used to accelerate spaceships to very close to light speed.
* Power generation use: edging effect and gravitational pull; An artificial mini black hole could be used to power huge interstellar ships. Or anything else that requires a lot of energy. If we ever get to make these, we might dismantle our Sun in favor of more energy from black holes. Supermassive black holes could be the only powersource left when stars died out. They will emit next to no energy. If we still somehow manage to capture that tiny trickle, it will last almost forever. This energy could for instance be used to create a simulated universum (this is likely how Fepulans powers their civilization, living on the edge of a supermassive blackhole).
* Space use: container
* World use: tunnel to another world
* Warping use: fast travel
* Black-hole flavour wafer cookie: experience black-hole scale contraction without physical damage?ðŸ˜‚
