# Submersion Technologies

Tags: Technology, Tellus World

A series of technologies that can be used alone or together to enhance and provide a hyper-reality on top of virtual/hardware displays. This is like a different direction from Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality/XR and can be considered P9-Original.

Notice we don't take Ultralleap's AR or haptics - those are the wrong directions in VR, or what we call Emulated Reality/Fake Reality. It's not really helpful as "Submersion" goes and is only trying to virtualize/mimic real sensations.

Naming: Here is a very saucy translation - 浸吟/浸荧.

# Description

Currently we have a few modes. The setup requires only a few dimensional data: precise measurement of monitor (display-area) size, and precise location of both eyes or center of eyes. We care NOT the gaze direction, but we do care the relative direction and thuse the orientation of eye/view plane.

## Upper Body + Hand Motion

Leap Motion + Oak-Lite-D + OpenGL/Open Game Engine/Unreal Engine <!--Those names might be actual in-novel names-->: Submersive 3D Editor/Modeler with Gesture Control.

## Upper Body Motion for FPS/TPS Games

(Game, Entrepreneurship, Redream, Project Nine, Technology, P9 Wiki, Dream Inspired, #20220526) <!--(Unrecorded Dream) The dream was originally playing Escape from Tarkov with him, inside a theatre like environment's fancy modern entrance hall with dark-glossy glass windows-->

一个公司提供的FPS相关的显示器attachment（挂/载件），叫做“晒书”——原先是逻辑游戏音箱的额外听众spatialization feature但是通过显示器挂件/载件的形式实现多方使用。原理很简单：挂件上提供whatver传感器array来可以感受玩家的肢体动作和gesture，这样的gesture只用来提供一个功能：额外的FPS虚拟角色posture adjustment。在第三人称动作里面不会影响camera但是可以看到虚拟角色根据玩家posture一些相应的上身肢体动作（提供一个hyper-interactivity来实现submersion），在第一人称游戏里面头部的位置可以直接用来影响摄影机位置。这种体验称作sub-emersive或者sub-amersive/submersion体验。
这种晒书架构是一个API，允许不同产商生产具体的implementation。<!--(Remark, Terminology) The word "晒书" can be treated as a 泊来词（like 沙发）—— the source language is Tellurian word "Shayshu". -->
知名Brand包括：八方 (Sqaure shape, Top Attached)，麦可 (Rounded Speaker-like shape; Top attached), ???? (Double module, side attached)

（现实中好像已经有一个类似的技术但是价格高的离谱 - Tobii Eye Tracker 5 - which is super dumb because it actually tries to detect EYE direction and has super long latency instead of just detection head motion，Tobii's falure is in head tracking is totally auxiliary because it's trying to sell eye tracking control. 相比之下Oak-Lite-D应该已经完全可以用来替代和cover其价格）<!--https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4839304/--> <!--Amazon dedicated head detectio: https://www.amazon.ca/Tracking-Professional-Infrared-TrackClip-Reflector/dp/B09NGNVJBR, https://www.amazon.ca/TrackIR-TrackNP-Tracking-Professional-Infrared/dp/B09KGK9C6B-->
