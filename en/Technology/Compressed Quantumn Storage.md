## Type A - Yarov-Ablakov backpack

Storing items and equipment, shrinks items with quantum singularity and restore upon extraction.

## Type B - Quantum Cache

In the year 2143, humanity has advanced beyond their wildest imagination. One of their greatest achievements is the invention of Quantum Cache – a storage technology that harnesses the peculiar laws of quantum mechanics to store objects in an almost negligible amount of space. Quantum Cache operates on the principle of quantum superposition, which allows particles to exist in multiple states at once. This ground-breaking invention has led to a whole new frontier in storage technology by shrinking objects to their quantum states and storing them in a highly stable and energy-efficient environment known as a quantum subspace.

To use Quantum Cache, users must first possess an authorized Quantum Cache Containment Unit (QCCU), a sleek and portable device resembling a large tablet. This QCCU employs minuscule nano-quantum manipulators, enabling objects to be encoded at a quantum level while preserving their macroscopic properties. To store an object, the user places the item within the designated storage compartment on the QCCU's surface. Next, the user activates the quantum encoding process via a simple voice command, touch or thought, as the QCCU incorporates advanced neural interface technology.

The QCCU then carefully analyzes the object's atomic and molecular structure before beginning the delicate encoding process. State-of-the-art nano-quantum manipulators meticulously deconstruct the object, breaking it down into billions of quantum bits (qubits) that encode the object's entire physical structure. These qubits are then transferred into the QCCU's quantum subspace chamber, a highly stable and secure storage medium. The object's physical presence, now existing solely in a superposition of states, occupies a minute fraction of its original volume. As a result, the user can store hundreds – even thousands – of objects in a device no larger than a book.

Retrieving objects from the Quantum Cache is equally user-friendly. Upon the user's command, the QCCU sifts through the stored digital-blueprints and selects the desired object. The nano-quantum manipulators then perform a remarkable feat, reversing the encoding process by using the qubits to reconstruct the object instantaneously. In a dazzling display of quantum reconstruction, the object materializes before the user's eyes, as if by magic.

The invention of Quantum Cache has revolutionized the way humanity interacts with the world. Its applications range from helping space travelers pack efficiently for long voyages to assisting disaster relief efforts by storing and transporting life-saving supplies. The possibilities are virtually limitless, as science uncovers new ways to harness the most enigmatic and powerful laws of the universe.

## Type C - Atomic Storage (For digital information only)

Introducing the revolutionary new technology: Atomic Storage. This cutting-edge system allows you to store vast amounts of data in an incredibly small space, using the principles of quantum mechanics to create a storage solution like no other.

With Atomic Storage, users can upload their digital files into a specially designed Atomic Storage device that uses individual atoms to store information. The atoms are arranged in a precisely encoded pattern, using quantum entanglement to ensure that the information remains secure, accurate and preserved over time. But it’s not just the tiny size that makes Atomic Storage such an amazing system. By utilizing quantum mechanics, this technology offers an unprecedented level of encryption, preventing data breaches or leaks. The advanced algorithms incorporated within Atomic Storage detect any unauthorized access attempts, making your data virtually unhackable.

To use Atomic Storage, simply connect your device to the storage unit and transfer your files using the special software provided. Given the tiny size of the Atomic Storage device, it can be used almost anywhere – from your smartphone to your PC, and even in wearable technology devices. With its compact and secure design, Atomic Storage offers an impressive storage capacity that vastly exceeds the capacities of current physical devices. And with the promise of unprecedented data protection and security, Atomic Storage is set to change the way we store and store our digital data forever.
