# Programmable Nano Robot

Tags: Sci-fi, Technology, Material Science

Programmable nano robot: either as direct novel bodily extensions, or when given an AI core and an interpretable/re-compilable system architecture, it can automatically program and adapt itself - early used as rovercrafts for planet exploration by space angencies. Requires programmable and compilation and material aquisition - those takes time and resources. (idea from) Extend and build functionalities for yourself.

This will be cool and fun if it requires extensive studies - like "leveling up" in skills, from high schools to colleges to universities. People devote their lives to the research and craftsmanship of this. For story purpose, the better narrative is from an artisan's practice perspective, because it's closer to the end product and more exciting.

Might need to consider which country/conutries have exclusive ownership (because of their superior technology, not because of political reasons) of such technology, and they may export them. Also interesting to consider what are the main providers of such materials and ready-to-use programs.
