# Gravity Technologies

Tags: High Sci-Fi, Medalian World

Anti-gravity in general, flying machines, faster-than light travel, and gravity shielding, gravity lock-down (detect and measure gravity on spherical spectrum) are common place (nonthless very very expensive) in Medalian world.

Krukian technology might even enable artificial gravity (non-mechanical) that direct generates gravity fields (NOT anti-gravity fields).
