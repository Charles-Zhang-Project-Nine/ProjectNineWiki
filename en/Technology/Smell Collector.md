# Smell Collector

Tags: Technology, Tellus World, Fantasy

Collect and release smells. Earlier versions are analog consumables: you can only release so much you have collected. Latter we may have digital versions (early ones are of course not ideal) that can synthesze smells. More advanced versions (might be some kind of Krukian tech) can directly stimulate neurons.
