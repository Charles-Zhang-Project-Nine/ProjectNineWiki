You think this would require advanced control system; Not really.

Looks like this thing depends on weight on the lower portion - the smaller wheels drives the rim.

## Notes

Originally thought this is very cool but pending deprecation and come up with better and new ideas if applicable.

"Because of the steering problem, monowheels have never caught on as a widely accepted mode of transportation." Also see this page on other issues: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monowheel, and relatively high center of gravity makes it hard to stop and control the stability. The risk of "gerbiling" is especially bad but can be controlled with active designs that limits braking. "In driver-inside designs, the rider is always facing the inner rim of the wheel, which can obstruct the view of oncoming hazards from all angles." is very bad as well - this can be overcome by a tilted design.
