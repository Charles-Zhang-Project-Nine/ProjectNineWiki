Anti-gravity stasis field device.

Producer: Produced by Medalians (Kruks don't have anti-gravity technology), imported by Kruks for various uses.

* (Note, #20230827) If not mass-produced, then this could be a lgendary one-of-its-kind device that's only made once with the entire Medalian civilization's resource, and was latter captured by Kruks, which spurs a great hatery between the two civilizations.
