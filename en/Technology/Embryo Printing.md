# DNA/Embryo Printing

Tags: #Legendary

Exclusive technology to (Some alien civilization). Contrary to popular belief (e.g. Jurrasic Park in our world), even with perfect prevervation of DNA, it's a totally different story to recreate one instance from it. For animal growth is a biological process and DNA alone doesn't provide enough material. Embryo Printing is the technology the recreates not just a proper embryo but simulates the entire growth environment for a (likely) species instance to grow - even so there are great chanllenges due to epigentics. (Some alien civlization) is the only one that can adequately use this technology.
