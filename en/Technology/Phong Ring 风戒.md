## Variation of Styles

Besides the usual ring style and association with ID Cards, there is also a ring version with small screens, a SmartWatch version, and cute handbag/玩偶 version <!--The Super Dimension Fortress Macross anime movie style - portable pouch of Freya the mobile phone; Pending analysis of cost for producing such irregular shaped device - but NFC should indeed promote individuality over mass production-->.

## Usages

* <!--(Trivia) (Dream Inspired, Unrecorded, 20220314) According to an Emmy Award event when we see some Actress using this technology-->You can control mute and open mode by simply using a V shaped (starwar) gesture - or in other words it just depends on whether both sides of the PR are touching other fingers. (When it's touching, mic is muted)
