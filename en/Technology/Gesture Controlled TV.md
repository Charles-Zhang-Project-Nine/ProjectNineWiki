# Gesture Controlled TV

Tags: Tellus World

(Project Nine, Application, Vision, Scenario, #20220414, Dream Inspired) Google Earth AR TV. In the future the TVs are so advanced it's like using VR without wearing VR headsets - you can do gesture controls (albelt wobbling as instability still exists especially when not directly standing in front of the TV) directly. Some scenarios I had when during the dream: browsing an google-earth like app which spans knowledge across Galaxy and type using in-air virtual hover keyboard with advanced gesture prediction, and use gestures to quickly zoom in and zoom out and switch applications. When you sit down, those gestures are usually not recognized. It's realistic in a sense that there is NO hologram nor any sort of fancy stable protected attachments, but it's just convenient. (This is clearly a Tellurian technology) (During our design we can envision more the people behind this technology)

Summary: It's like a typical usual flat LED tv, but with gesture control.
