<!--Inspiration from 20220509 unrecorded dream.-->

A clock-like device that (potentially) mdssss up user's brain and speeds up time.

It can be used sparingly to skip a few minutes, or it can even be used to skip ahead hours for a group of people. Longer skipping time can be much worse potential effect on body due to lack of attendance and other psychological effects.

## Legacy

Maybe this is a LEGENDARY item that's collected by the current owner (invented by Fepulans players) - this way it's unique and there is only one; Otherwise it should be mass-produced and many people from that civilization know of it.
