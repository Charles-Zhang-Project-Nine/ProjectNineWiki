> 时间只是人脑海中的概念，改变时间只需要改变人的记忆。Time is but an illusion of human mind;To change (perceived) time just change people's memory (Time is a mental concept, to reset time, we just need to change people's perception of it)

First conceived and invented by Kun V, the experimental use of this device received a direct warning from the Creators (Fepulans), so later generations are advised not to use it. The more localized effect (both spatially and temporally) are perfectionized by Kun VII, as seen in her fight with Mr. Leng.

The technical concept behind this is **normalization (正态化)** - there are two possible implementations: 1) a save-point is first created, then it's possible to recover back to the save point, this affects either regionally or globally but the scope is universal; 2) Analyze only that are changed and operate on people's memory. This gives a non-universal change BUT the energy cost is not necessarily lower.

清零操作是一个recursive operation，首先修改相关人员记忆，然后在一定范围内重造或者毁灭不符合记忆的事物。Such a reset must happen in a *normalized domain* <!--We could use cooler terminology.--> so everything can be consistent - to carry on such operation, start with a given subject, then recursively remove the memory of connected subjects.

This is debated by some as a "massive brain control weapon" and some Medalians (legitimately) expresses their concerns that they might have been brainwashed without knowing it.
