# Temporal (Mini) Blackhole Bomb

Tags: Medalian World

Temporal (controllable by manufacture) radius blackhole that can suck everything inside it; It later releases a violent plasma (heat) wave in long distances. Very portable but the damage range is much bigger than the core blackhole radius so very dangerous.
