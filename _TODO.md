# TODO

<!-- Should we use projects? Projects is reserved for published Project Nine tasks to the public, which we shall not use now. 
Should we use Issues for todo? Issues should really be used for technical issues - some of the "todos" might be issues.
Should we use Discussion for ideas, advice, feature requests, and issues? Maybe. Again, that's for public use, for internal and collaborator use, we just use this TODO.
