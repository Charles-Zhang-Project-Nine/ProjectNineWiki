The city-wise civil service and knowledge database, tightly integrated into **NFC Open Platform**. NFC libraries provide books and internet/intranet service to all citizens, and it's also a major source for finding jobs and (self)learning stuff. There are three major sites (called Central Libraries) across the city - one of them is the biggest one and most comprehensive; There are a few dozen or even over hundred satellite sites. NFC libraries also provide important informative civil services where citizens can ask questions about government related stuff, tax issues, law etc. civil inquiries.

The main branches provides all services provided by satellite branches plus:

1. Advanced/Comprehensive book catalog
2. Advanced multi-media AR/VR learning booth
3. Job finding consultation (with humans)
4. Robotic librarian

(The central libraries usually have dedicated parks and may also be partially responsible for hosting and managing NFC Open Platform in nearby operational buildings so security can be quite tight there.)

Those services are provided at all branches:

1. Book catalog: reading and borrowing services
2. Computer and terminal access: internet and intranet service (the intranet service provides personal storage through cloud)
3. Reading place
4. Public washrooms
5. Water fountains <!--(Comment) For drinkg water, like in Toronto.-->
6. Civil information services (with humans): Civil service helpers will provide direct information or otherwise provide pointers for further information

Those services are optional at satellite branches but available in major branches:

1. Meeting rooms
2. Catering services <!--(Comment) Food is an important element at NFC -->
3. Librarian services and research help
4. Learning booth
5. Server rental: for hosting personal services on dedicated machines (public service hosting is generally easily accessible through NFC Open Platform)
6. Information booths (optionally AI assisted high sci-fi touch screen booths)

## Notes

<!-- Put those to P9 Dated -->

**书籍版面和设计考虑因素** <!--Do notice this is pertaining to #in-world design elements and considerations, not meta-world or #out-world-->

* 美术书籍如果使用双页的画会有很多细节流失在页缝中。不知道LimitedEdition和SoftCover在这上面会是什么样的效果？
	* 这指导我们开发书的时候最好也是能够先有个原型体验一下，然后才能够发现和解决这种问题。
* 一些数学书之类的纸张在光源看书的时候会有很明显的反光有些刺眼睛。
