# Project Nine Wiki Community Guidelines

Language: English

Project Nine wiki is physically-based, meaning it only describes physical existence and reality of things. Unlike traditional online wikis, P9 wikis intend to provide a linear experience, and knowledge treatment is comprehensive and self-contained on all pages - in general, avoid unnecessary interlinking.  
Eventually, all contents from P9 Rev1 will be made available publically after they are cleaned up and have properly dealt with potential copyright issues.  
For plot discussions, use [Discussion](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Project-Nine/ProjectNineWiki/discussions/categories/general).

Plan for using posts:

* We might use Posts to post monthly e-magazine as a precursor to 九层楼志 magazine
* Save images for Posts in dedicated Post folder on Cloudinary.

## Rules

0. In general, we treat English as official definitions. English is also all-evasive proper management-time, design-time, and meta-data language. Consider all other content languages (including English itself) are localizations only.
1. All wiki topics must be approved through formal discussion process.
2. Use [Issues](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Project-Nine/ProjectNineWiki/issues) to fire issues on technical and design problems
3. DO NOT PUT media or binary file in this repo! To serve images, use Cloudinary or Uploadcare (or other static image hosting solutions or CDNs). If you are a collaborator, you should have received an image invitation to a team folder on Cloudinary. Images should not exceed ***1MB***. Images names must follow convention `<category>-<entry_name>.jpg` (all lower case).
4. In general, each wiki entry should have only a single title/portrait image, and use other images very carefully and sparingly. 
5. Use tables and mermaid diagrams to help format information better.
6. Topics should be flat (single layer of topic hierarchy).
7. All images need to be documented.
8. Generally, avoid explicit interlinks between wiki articles - keep each entry self-contained and avoid depending on HTML features. This keeps the entire things more readable and manageable on the long term, and more convenient when printing as PDF. On the other hand, we could use **bold** font to emphasize terms that relate to another wiki entry when it *first appears* in the wiki article.
9. To avoid unnecessary management and scripting burden, all meta-data and management-time or internal representation data should be in ENGLISH proper. E.g. Even in Chinese languaged posts, tags are in English. Although we do occasionally use Chinese for tags for words we don't have an English word for yet - we will eventually use all English.

## Tips

* You can use Cloudinary online tools to format the images.

## Standards

* Generally, multi-language versions of the same article should follow the exact same sort of path structure
* Generally, we must manually explicitly provide English/Chinese version mapping on the individual posts - this is equivalent to makking an automatic mapping
