# Project Nine Wiki Community Guidelines

Project Nine wiki is physically-based, meaning it only describes physical existence and reality of things. For plot discussions, use [Discussion](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Project-Nine/ProjectNineWiki/discussions/categories/general).

## Rules

1. All wiki topics must be approved through formal discussion process.
2. Use [Issues](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Project-Nine/ProjectNineWiki/issues) to fire issues on technical and design problems
3. DO NOT PUT media or binary file in this repo! To serve images, use Cloudinary or Uploadcare (or other static image hosting solutions or CDNs). If you are a collaborator, you should have received an image invitation to a team folder on Cloudinary. Images should not exceed ***1MB***. Images names must follow convention `<category>-<entry_name>.jpg` (all lower case).
4. In general, each wiki entry should have only a single title/portrait image, and use other images very carefully and sparingly. 
5. Use tables and mermaid diagrams to help format information better.
6. Topics should be flat (single layer of topic hierarchy).

## Tips

* You can use Cloudinary online tools to format the images.

## Standards

* Generally, multi-language versions of the same article should follow the exact same sort of path structure
* Generally, we must manually explicitly provide English/Chinese version mapping on the individual posts - this is equivalent to makking an automatic mapping
