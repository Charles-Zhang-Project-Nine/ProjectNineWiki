# High Management (Wiki-like)

ALL DOCUMENTS HERE MUST BE ENGLISH(MANAGEMENT-TIME-DESIGN-NOTE-LANGUAGE)-DOMINANT OR MIXED-LANGUAGES (aka. it could contains Chinese or other languages if we don't know how to write in English properly).

Wiki-like non-in-world-entity but pertaining to Project Nine management.  
Typically such notes could be effectively put into dated, but (as of 20240119) we are experimentally putting them here as separate wiki-like articles to encourage continuous editing.
(We would keep a date tag, so worst case, we will just migrate back to P9 dated)
Contents in this folder are not intended for fully accessible public access (but it's still accessible) and thus won't provide multilingual versions.
